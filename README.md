Machine Learning Scraping and Sentiment Analysis of Breaking Bad Reviews
Technologies: python , Django , ML , scrapping data, html ,css

Description
For my exam project, I chose to scrape reviews and apply machine learning techniques. Specifically, I focused on Breaking Bad reviews. I scraped the data and processed it using Python to handle null values and duplicates. I then generated a machine learning model to achieve high accuracy. The project includes a detailed sentiment analysis based on this model to ensure precision. Additionally, I developed a Django application that allows users to enter reviews and predicts whether the sentiment is neutral, positive, or negative.

Key Features
Scraping Data with BeautifulSoup and Selenium: Collect reviews from multiple sites using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
Unify Data in One Data Source via Python: Merge and clean the scraped data into a single, unified data source using Python.
Machine Learning Process and Treatment: Process the data for machine learning, handling null values and duplicates.
Apply Machine Learning Algorithms: Implement and train machine learning models to analyze sentiment with high accuracy.
Download Blob Model for Prediction: Save the trained machine learning model as a blob for prediction purposes.
Inject Model into Django Interface: Integrate the machine learning model into a Django application for real-time predictions.
User Review Input and Prediction Display: Allow users to input reviews in the Django interface and display the predicted sentiment (neutral, positive, or negative).
