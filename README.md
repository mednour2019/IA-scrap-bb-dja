# Machine Learning Scraping and Sentiment Analysis of Breaking Bad Reviews
# The project is in master Branch
# Description
For my exam project, I chose to scrape reviews and apply machine learning techniques. Specifically, I focused on Breaking Bad reviews. I scraped the data and processed it using Python to handle null values and duplicates. I then generated a machine learning model to achieve high accuracy. The project includes a detailed sentiment analysis based on this model to ensure precision. Additionally, I developed a Django application that allows users to enter reviews and predicts whether the sentiment is neutral, positive, or negative.
