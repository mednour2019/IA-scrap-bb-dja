  This item arrived quickly Via Amazon prime.The picture quality of this Blu-ray is on par. I have personally read over the years that the picture quality for season one on Blu-ray was substandard. I have not found that to be the case. There is plenty of fine detail to be seen on the show in season one. It is a huge leap in terms of visual and audio quality over the DVD.The plot of the show is rather simple. A middle-aged science teacher named Walter White is diagnosed with late stage lung cancer. With a second child on the way, and his family's debt climbing by the moment, he uses his knowledge of chemistry to dive into the lucrative world of drug manufacturing, to make sure that his family is financially secure after his death.There's a reason that Breaking Bad is considered one of the greatest shows in television history. The writing here is simply phenomenal, the character development is far above par, and the acting is nearly flawless. These Blu-rays provide the best audio and visual quality you're going to get out of the show. When compared to the DVD, there simply no contest. The technical quality is outstanding. I highly recommend it.

  What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the veryfew series that competes with the best films in history for achievement in cinematic storytelling.Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing.A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer tomake money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtakingperformance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles,this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker andmore disturbing each year.In a way, thematically it recalls ""The Godfather I and II"" in how that epic charts Michael's journeyfrom innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the endless drive for moneyand success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes anend in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in agame we can never win.It may take a few episodes to get into, in this first season there was a lot of groundwork to lay,but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff.

  If you're just starting this series then this will of course blow your mind and begin to take over your life. You'll start skipping going out with friends and family to stay in and binge watch this season. So just decide right now whether you want to keep it around forever on DVD, or DL it. DVD's will probably become obsolete in the not so distant future so you might as well digitize it.

  My husband and I are clearly behind the 8 ball in watching this series.  After we got tired of hearing everyone talking about it, we rented Season 1 from Amazon.  Binged watched the entire season in one weekend !!!  Fantastic plot.  Needless to say we were in love with Dexter - heartbroken when it ended and this series while not ""Dexter""like, had the same overtones of someone who is really smart in one area and uses it to forward his mission/objective.  After we binged watch the first season, we decided to drop the cash to buy the entire 6 series on Amazon.  If we emerge from our homes in a week, you'll know it was too good to turn off !

  I watched episode 1 and then bought the whole season.it certainly sets the stage.  I wonder if sales went up on Winnebagos, Glock22s,.40 cal pistols, and jockey shorts.  Desert camping and tourism in Arizona and New Mexico may have been boosted, too, all by the first episode.  You kind of understand Walter White's frame of mind, even as irrational as it is.  Bryan Cranston is a pretty good actor.  Get it. Streaming quality is excellent.Jim

  After watching Dexter and Homeland, I needed a replacement pacifier so I ordered Breaking Bad. Man, was I really glad I did!Aaron and Bryon ( two main acting characters) are off the chart GREAT! This show has got to be one of the best real to life shows on the airright now. I know the Hollywood writers keep us entertained a lot but this has got to  be one of those shows that does a gearshift in our thinking on what's going on in the world let alone tweak our morality a bit as to ""why"" we are watching, . .  Breaking Bad. Hahaha.It's really a good series. Our backs are against the wall, we get diagnosed with a disease and we love our family. So whatdoes a good loving husband do to counter a situation that seemingly will leave his spouse and cripple son in a bad spot? Hesteps into Haedes and ruins his life and reputation. Kind of poses a question to us all with all the fees, taxes, health reform andmonetary calamity we see in our society these days. Breaking Bad is a ""Very"" good show.

  Hey, I make joke in my headline!  Seriously, I can't imagine anyone reading yet one more raving review of this series and suddenly being convinced that it's worth the time, but I will say it emphatically... absolutely, one of the (if not THE) best TV series ever produced.  I came to the show late (only a few months back) as I have such a disdain for so much TV.  Only a relative handful of programs win my respect, and I think perhaps none more so than ""Breaking Bad"".The premise is simple- so much so that it's the reason I wasn't interested sooner.  How could a series built on a chemistry teacher turned drug maker/dealer sustain or rise above anything but some silly, stereotypical, profanity-laced, overly-violent drudge that is so much a part of our entertainment media.What I learned by about the 3rd or 4th episode is that it is written by people fully aware of the pitfalls and predictability of modern television; they have, instead created characters with such depth, and plot twists so complex, that I had become sucked in like some drug addict, suffering the joys and anguish and yet demanding more.  Characters are multifaceted, and you are expected to hate them and root for them at the same time.  This is such an amazing achievement in writing and acting... the acting, of course, is first rate.TV is really reaching a magnificent period.  Of course, network and cable are being dragged down by those bored enough to obsess over ""reality"" television and obnoxious crime stories.  Beautiful actors and actresses under 35 adorn most of the roles (being beautiful, smart, and fearless is also ""reality"" in the TV world of crime), all of which make shows like ""Breaking Bad"", ""Mad Men"" and a smattering of HBO shows, exceptional.Again, among the best, ""Breaking Bad"" rises to the top.

  This show is such a ground breaker.  I don't watch too many TV shows, but this one drew me in right off the bat with one important quality- humor.While this is a dark show about chemistry teacher Walter H. White breaking bad to cook meth to provide for his family since he has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, there are several funny moments you won't see coming.  This kick off season puts the ball in motion and if you don't get hooked, I would be shocked.  Even better is that the price of this product is so low as well.  Most series want you to pay to even see if the series appeals to you or not but this one invites you right in and the ride never stops.  Love this show and as a crime fiction writer, it is straight up my alley.  The longer you don't watch this show, the more you are robbing yourself!

  This is the second of two AMC series I went to catch up with, because this and ""Mad Men"" were constantly winning awards, and my favorites were being left in the dust. Both series had a hurdle for me. How can I possibly empathize with a meth manufacturer and dealer (the two lead roles). As it turns out, the story line is so inventive and so believable that it is hard not be be drawn into the perils of these characters which are so totally under water. The story on the face of it is so tense, that the show's creator had to add to the premise the fact that the brother in law of the Walter White (Brian Cranston) is a lead DEA agent, and, in most regards, a pretty good one. Perhaps one of the only improbabilites of the first season is that this DEA agent comes so close to gathering evidence which implicates Walter, but he doesn't catch on.Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the story is seeing the extent to which people will do totally out of character things, things which are not only illegal (as one may think about drug business as a victimless crime), but violently illegal, including multiple murders. The acting by Cranston and Brian Paul, his ""dealer"" is superb, worthy of their Emmy wins. I must also give a good word for Raymond Cruz, who does a character far, far different from his police detective role on ""The Closer / Major Crimes"". The tension between his character Tuco and Walter White holds one's attention like little I've seen elsewhere.This is not for everyone, but watching one or two episodes shows why this one wins awards, and shows such as ""White Collar"", ""Royal Pains"", and ""Suits"" do not.

  I'm coming to this whole party a little bit late.  I have a somewhat unusual situation to report:  I was primary caregiver for a dad who passed from cancer.Right around the time this show started back in '08 or so, was when it was all starting to come down for us.  I think I watched a few of the first episodes actually together *with* my dad, and he felt it was hitting too close to home, too painful to watch.  I had a lot of work to do taking care of him, so I basically didn't have much time for appointment television back then, and I eventually forgot about the show.Well, here it is, the ending season of the show, and I've watched almost none of it.  I really felt left out, hearing people talk about this on Twitter and FB, so I felt like now that I have the time, I'll go back and catch up.Well, I'm really glad I did, and I think I'm in for the duration.  This show deserves a place amongst the greatest shows in modern tv history, it's so well done.

  While I am enjoying the show, Sony apparently feels that its paying customers must endure a 5 minute bluray commercial EVERY TIME you try and play the thing. And disable the menu so you can't get right in and watch. The loading time is about 3 or 4 minutes even before the commercial starts. And I am using a recent sony player. Absolutely horrible. Buy a DVD and suffer a little less quality for more speed!

  Only the greatest show I have ever seen, had n*tfl*x at the time. First season is so funny. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are fantastic together, rest of the cast is great as well. DVD still holding up after all these yrs, in fact we recently started watching it again, now on 3rd season. HIGHLY recommend!

  Who doesn't like the Breaking Bad series, it's edgy, sinister and sucks you into the story. But remember you need to start form the beginning of this story to get the true feeling of what happens and why. Having lived through the 60's I have seen people that easily fit into the characters of this story. It is scary that such people exist but life is full of viciousness and men that don't care about anything but their own version of how to live and treat other people. This is a story about people who teeter on the edge of both worlds and how they manage to slip off one side or the other and back again. You learn to hate them and to have sympathy for them but then realize it was their choice that lead them down the rabbit hole. Like dominoes, one thing leads to another and before you know it you are plugging yourself into the story line, good luck with your out come.

  My husband talked me into watching this. I never would have watch this on my own, but I'm glad I did. It is so well done and covers so many tough issues without judgement: drugs, crime, facing death...  Unlike a lot of shows, drugs are not glamorized. If you know anyone thinking of cooking (or using) meth, tell them to watch this show. THe characters are real rather than pretty, they look like your neighbors. They are not ""cool"" like sit com characters and they have to face the consequences of their actions.The script and scenes are genius. Odd camera angles and funky time lapses add to the story rather than distract from it. The characters are excellent,  even the characters that are despicable you want to see more of because they are so well-written.Warning: There are some intense scenes, violence, nudity (not pretty nude people usually either) and bad language. It feels like real life in the drug scene.I'm into the 4th season now. Season 1 is very mild in comparison. They get more intense with each season. Season 1 is only edgy, this series gets dark quickly.

  I like the series even though it wasn't what I expected. I thought the main character of the high school chemistry teacher turned meth lord was going to be harder, but so far I'm starting the third season and he's still not what you would think a drug lord would be. That may be what keeps me watching but I must admit I'm waiting for the tough guy to show up and not the chemistry teacher turned jerk off.  Overall, it's a good storyline, but I sadly like the drug addict more than the dying high school teacher unable to pay his medical treatment, which is not how I expected to feel when I started watching the show. After finishing the second season last night, I don't even like his wife any longer. I feel somewhat guilty watching a show where I like the criminal characters more than the ""good guy"", but I'm still watching so that must mean it's a good show.

  Wow!!!!!!!!!!!  We hadn't watched this series when it was on TV, but after being bombed by references to it (""Who the heck is Heisenberg??), I decided to buy this boxed set for my husband.  We were ""Sopranos"" addicts and we both enjoy dark humor, so I thought we'd like this?""Like"" turns out to be an understatement!  We fully intend to watch the entire series - the characters draw you in; one minute you're laughing - the next, you're gasping in horror - and then laughing again.  Some episodes have director's comments - they helped us get a good grasp of the story and the characters.This isn't a show for everyone - the main characters are flawed.  There's graphic violence and crude language and nudity.  The star of the show is making meth.  If you can get past all that, you'll find you really care about the characters, and can laugh, cry, gasp...and thoroughly enjoy this show!

  In my opinion, this is the best series ever on television.  It begins in Season One with gripping episodes- and then does nothing but get better and better throughout the next 4 seasons.  The acting is top notch, the plot lines are incredible and just about every episode leaves you saying ""Wow!!""  Once you start watching, you won't stop.  The idea of basing a series around a couple guys making meth did not draw me in originally, but the transformation of Walter White from a timid school teacher to a drug lord is fascinating.  This is ground breaking, landmark television at its finest-  It's hard to believe that Bryan Cranston could go from Malcolm In the Middle to this series- and he pulls it off flawlessly.  I will miss this show when it ends, but it has set the bar very high for other shows in the future.

  But after giving several episodes a whirl, we actually found ourselves eagerly plowing through all available seasons (back to back) for several weeks right up and through the last available show. While the casts intentions were generally initially good (well, thats the approach we understood it to be), sometimes things are simply beyond everyones control - and this television series exploits all kinds of aspects of what can (and certainly will) go wrong in life, especially if you elect a life comprised of criminality attributes. Sometimes it was just so silly and stupid, that you can guess whats going to happen next, but other times, the performance is both chaotic and entertaining at the same time (those who have seen it, how about the entire show based upon a fly). Different, entertaining and we like it. Looking forward to the next season (Summer 2013).

  I am just amazed with every single episode of this series, it is so well written and acted by an amazing cast with a Brian Cranston we have never met before as Walter White, and Aaron Paul, who plays Jessie Pinkman, a character that is perfect as Walt's business partner. The entire cast of this show is just amazing, and the story line is absolutely flawless in every way. This show is definitely made for adult viewing, which is clear from the first episode. I have never been so glued to my seat watching anything like I have with this show. Not wanting to give anything away regarding the story, but this is perfection if you aren't averse to some very adult viewing. This show has you going OMG one minute and laughing the next. Bravo to Vince Gilligan who wrote this and to the excellent cast for bringing it to life. What a wild ride!!!!

  I would like to first start off saying this season came in speedy fast from my favorite seller.This is a very good show to get into either now or in the past. The cover featured the main character Walter White who is diagnosed with Lung Cancer and finds a way to get money to get treatments as well as money saved away for his family when he passes away. He starts cooking meth with a former high school chemistry student. It is a nonstop roller coaster of a show and I ordered this because I am anticipating the fifth season to come out.Some things you need to know about this season in particular are:1) This season is only 7 forty-five minute episodes.2) You might want to get this and season 2 (13 episodes) due to the fact it just ends on a cliffhanger.

  Love, love, love Breaking Bad!!!  Wish the series hadn't ended.  I had already received all the seasons as Christmas gifts.  Unfortunately, I lent Season 1 to someone who never returned it, so I had to order another Season 1 CD.  As usual with Amazon, it arrived quickly!

  I should say I don't really watch TV on a regular basis. Any series I like I will find on Bluray at some point. I feel even some of the better shows on TV have a little too much relation to TV instead of film which I am not really fond of watching. Even The Sopranos sometimes veered into this direction. BB doesn't do it often and for what you get... man this is good. The first season could possibly be the best but I leave that up to the viewer. I just have to say that if you are an adult with a penchant for realistic dialogue, absurdly good acting, and a story that has you addicted as the material the series is based on, then this one is for you. I guess you can critique some of the outlandish stuff that happens in seasons going forward, but it is still a small critique. BB has all the elements of a great film, just expanded in scope to make a series. I wouldn't miss this if I were you. Not for kids.

  I have been very reluctant to get into these long running shows on TV, as I prefer a self contained story as presented in a movieformat.  However, a friend showed me the first chapter at his house, and I was hooked.  Since then, I not only purchased thecomplete first season, which I have now watched fully, but the entire 6 season run, and am totally mesmerized by the quality andcomplexity of the production.  The acting and actors are excellent, with each character fully developed, and not just a plot point.The scripts are amazing.  Each chapter has unexpected twists, and a lot of humor to go with the suspense and darkness of thethemes.  A wonderful and outstanding series, worthy of all the praise and awards heaped on it.

  Writers are more important to the process than actors.  I still subscribe to that theory, but Bryan Cranston has shaken that belief.  His performance in 'Breaking Bad' rises to a new level.The writing on this series is exceptional, but I can't turn away from this character.  Walter White is like a great hitter in his prime, when he's at the plate you aren't going into the kitchen.Cranston TRULY makes the actors around him better.  As the series progresses, EVERYONE improves.  That, in itself, makes this series worth watching.The subject is serious and the story is dark.  It is almost impossible to explain to people how/why the show is so funny.  Vince Gilligan (the creator) calls BB a comedy and that's the way I see it.  You may need a strong stomach, but shouldn't great story effect your digestive system?I realize that this review is 'all over the map', but you have to watch this series.  It is the best thing on TV.

  Breaking Bad from the perspective of just telling a story, is the greatest TV series ever, it is a must watch. Don't start in the middle, it's like a book, you must start at the first page to get all the wonderful nuance of it.Don't be fooled this is not a TV series; it is a movie near a hundred hours long. It started as a TV series, there was a theme; Walter White a High School chemistry teacher, diagnosed with cancer starts cooking meth.  All the characters are assembled and developed into the theme, a concept. However what comes out is a well plotted story where there is a beginning and there is an end, and what is between is the journey between the two.More TV should be like this.

  Good. Surprised how quickly the show escalates. The plot moves much faster than b.c.s. Very fast show. Lots of violence. Not for kids. Very entertaining. It's sorta like death note where the you want the main character to fail.

  The DVD arrived on time and as pictured. After just the first season I am hooked. The writers/producers have masterfully combined an exceptional cast, engaging plot, and just the right amounts of fact and fiction to keep it interesting. I am also pleased that sexual content is kept to a minimum and writers/producers haven't resorted to sex/nudity to keep the public watching. They have developed the characters to a point that you actually feel their pain and will care when things happen to them as the series progresses. I just bought the entire series from Amazon as well. My only complaint is that boxset is kind of cheaply made. Not the greatest materials were used to house the DVDs.

  I've enjoyed the ever changing plots and I think okay this is where he gets caught  but he always pulls a rabbit out of his hat.Of course I don't approve of the drug aspects but it's a fact of life unfortunately .

  Let me start by saying, I don't even watch TV shows.  Not only do commercials absolutely suck me out of the moment (even DVR'd), but most aren't written well enough to keep me interested.  Not one, but then I heard about ""Breaking Bad"".  So, I watched the first episode, and I had to have more.  So I bought the first season to see what it would do for me.  And then I NEEDED more.  Breaking Bad, in my opinion is the greatest experience in TV entertainment, it was certainly the best I have ever had.  Bryan Cranston was amazing, and Aaron Paul was fantastic.  You will be missed Breaking Bad... thank you for 6 great years.

  I thought the show realistic in many, many ways. After that was discovered, any story it wanted to tell would be worth my time each week. I thought there were some odd directions the show moved toward were poor writing mixed with bad acting. But, that didn't deter me from enjoying it every week for a long time. I'm not saying it was perfect. I had come to many of the same conclusions during my 54 years incarnate in this country. And, it was nice to see someone else had reached them as well. Enjoyable, show.  The Beach Astrologer

  As someone who hates television and doesn't currently have access to TV shows other than through Amazon Prime or Netflix  I'm really hard pressed to use my time in front of the screen.  However, this one could justify binge watching.  Even the behind the scenes clips are entertaining.  This is such a well casted and well acted series.  It's everything its been tauted to be.  It's certainly not a disapointment and definitely makes an impact.  Watching the main character evolve is so much fun and so gripping.  We're trying to make it last because we know now what everyone means when they say they are going through withdrawal from Breaking Bad.

  I've now caught up on BREAKING BAD by watching all of Season One on DVD and Season Two on DVR.  I've been extremely impressed by what I've seen so far, and consider all that I've seen so far to be first rate.  While I'm not yet convinced that this is going to end up a truly great series, it clearly has enormous potential and is buoyed by several exceptional performances, especially by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.Just about everything that has taken place so far on the show has been beyond criticism.  My hesitation in proclaiming this a masterpiece or even one of the best shows currently on television stems from a lack of sense what the endgame of the show is.  Only time will eliminate my hesitancy.  If it turns out that Vince Gilligan has a clear vision of where this show will eventually end up and if that vision is compelling, then this will indeed go down as a great series.  Does Gilligan have a rough storyboard for the entire series?  Or does he just have a rough idea of where the next season is going?  It is an important distinction.  Although Ron Moore repeatedly hinted that he had only a few ideas of where he was taking BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, the ending and the way it deeply coheres with so much that happened even in the first couple of seasons leads me to believe that he was essentially deceiving us and really knew all along.  Contrast this with a series that was just making it up as it went along, THE X-FILES (a series upon which Gilligan worked extensively).  Although there were many great episodes on that show and a host of memorable aspects, in the end it was a show that was greatly harmed by the ramshackle long story arc, with a host of variant versions of key events (e.g., what precisely happened to Mulder's sister and who his father was, answers to which changed several times over the course of the show).  We simply haven't had enough episodes of BREAKING BAD for us to tell whether there is an end towards which everything is pointing.That being said, there are a number of things I really love about this show.  Sticking with narrative structure for the moment, I like that many of the episodes more or less pick up from the end of the previous episode.  I'm a passionate believer in the superiority of serial narrative.  Almost without exception all the TV series that I have loved over the course of the past twenty years have featured serial narratives; virtually none have been episodic.  I love the complexity of character and story that can result from this.  And BREAKING BAD clearly has embraced the serial format.  This will, in the end, be a series with a definite beginning, middle, and end.I also have been blown away -- along with everyone else -- by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.  He was good in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, but he is so much better in this it is as if Jerry Seinfeld had gone to sleep and work up Laurence Olivier.  The range and depth of his performance is absolutely astonishing.  I especially love how nuanced he makes Walter.  Although someone engaged in criminal activity, he does so from a sense of moral obligation.  He is pursuing immoral means to achieve a moral end.  Above all he is a man dedicated to caring for his family.  At no point is this illustrated more than in the moment where he compiles a list of the reasons for sparing and the reasons for killing Crazy Eight, a drug dealer being held in his partner's basement.  In the ""not to kill"" column he has a long, long list of compelling reasons.  In the ""kill"" column, there is only one:  if he lets him go he will kill both him and his family.  That pretty much sums up Walter.  He will do no wrong, unless by so doing he endangers his family.Another thing I love about the show is the wide range of responses it evokes.  Although essentially a drama, I find myself laughing constantly.  His life has been reduced to one long absurdity, and Gilligan does not hesitate to emphasize this by showing how ridiculous things are.  But the show can turn on on a dime to go from humorous or dramatic, to out and out shocking.  There are many, many OMG! moments one the show.This has become one of the shows that I simply won't miss.  No one who cares about quality television should neglect catching up on this one ASAP.

  After the series ended, I really wanted to go back and see it from the beginning.  Having purchased and watched most of the first season, I see a lot of things I missed... making it even more enjoyable than it was originally.  The DVD set was just as described, brand new and factory sealed.  This amazing, innovative series is something I'd recommend to any BB fans as an addition to their DVD collection.  From the first episode to the final one in season 5, Breaking Bad keeps fans engaged. When the final half of season 5 is released later this month, I'll have the whole set.  BB has replaced all my other favorite shows, and for the time being, I'd rather watch reruns of it than the new episodes of other programs.  It is just that good.

  Don't buy this unless you are prepared to become addicted to entertainment. Unfortunately, at the suggestion of our youngest son and his wife, we bought this and got hooked. You know what some say about milder drug forms...they lead to bigger and badder stuff! We finished this and graduated to Amazon Prime subsequent episodes. We couldn't rest until we saw the final episode! So, buyer beware; unless you are prepared to be thrilled beyond your wildest hopes, don't buy this!

  I have seen every episode of this show. It's not very often that tv shows come along and completely captivate you. I didn't realize who Bryan Cranston was until I started watching reruns of Malcom In The Middle. I will watch the whole thing again too (Breaking Bad). Two completely different characters. Didn't dawn on me until several episodes later.

  I bought this as a gift for a friend in the USA. I live in Europe.We , in Europe, are waiting for the DVD The Complete Series 5 ,to come out in PAL frequency and it will be available on June 3rd. at Amazon.co.uk.! Looking forward to it.It is an outstanding series. Excellent actors, unusually well thought- out script not even spoiled by the crudity of the material andbackground.  The ""hero""  & his partner rise like ""a phoenixes out of the ashes"", just when we think all is lost for them.The ethical dilemma: ""Does the end justify the means?"". . . is glossed over and  is there & important! However, the story is still outstanding!

  During a wintery snow storm, we decided to dig in and watch all 5 seasons of Breaking Bad--and hence, we were blown away by this series!!If you haven't seen it--DEFINITELY watch it!  Amazingly intelligent writing, the acting was unsurpassed, and we may just watch it all over again.  Many twists and turns, you actually become very attached to each character.  The pilot for Season 1 was so intense, we couldn't wait to get to the rest of the seasons--and ended up ""binge watching"" all 5!!!  You will not be disappointed!!!!

  This is really not my kind of show, but like I always do, I pick it up and start watching after all the hype and usually after the show ends for good. This is the case here. I absolutely loved this series, the cast was fantastic, loved them all and loved to hate some. I got hooked on this show within the first 2 or 3 episodes and then of course had to have them all.....Amazon thank you for having these available to me.....If you really like good guy/bad guy you will really love this show...it is worth the $ to have it in your DVR library for another watch later in the years to come.....or share with friends.....Loved it.....

  Very great show with talented actors including Bryan Cranston(Walter White) who won an emmy award for Breaking Bad. I would definitely recommend getting this dvd set. I only have one small complaint which is that I wish all of it could fit on one disc instead of three since it's only 7 episodes but I guess its not their fault because dvd can't fit all of it like blu-ray can. This season starts off a little slow but it gets much better as it progresses into the second season. Very good action and even some funny moments. This set even contains deleted scenes, making of, and commentaries for the pilot episode as well. Can't wait until July which is when the next season starts!-Just an extra note. The dvd does not come with English subtitles for some reason which is kind of weird but it does have French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles.

"
  ...however interestingly, I left off for a couple of seasons, came back, and it was as though the series picked right up where it left off.  That is the core, the teacher 'Breaking Bad', the slow, easy migration into his new self, living a life he never intended. That which I missed was easily made up for by quickly adapting to their latest endeavors, and projecting what must have happened (which is not earth-shattering) while I took a break.I never got used to his partner in crime, something just doesn't work for me there. But the series has enough depth and subplots so that to some extent he's tolerable.

  Breaking Bad is so good that I decided to watch it all over again. It's the best television program ever offered, and, it may be better than 90% of all the films ever produced. It is not for the faint of heart. Be ready to be surprised at how many boundaries are crossed. If you want intensity, this is where to get it. Be prepared to be literally glued to the screen.

  Totally addictive! I bought the first season after hearing so many complementary reviews from friends, so I wanted to see it for myself. OMG, this is truly one of the finest series to have graced TV. I was hooked in the first 5 mins. The series tops itself at every turn, leaving the viewer shocked and awed. It is a dark but oddly relatable story. You feel for Walter's predicament, even though it does not excuse the criminal he becomes. I have since bought the rest of the series and am enjoying each episode. Very well done. Blows True Blood and Game of Thrones out of the water.

  We began watching this guilty pleasure  on the recommendation of one my favorite bloggers... and I tell you -this show has drama that is absolutely jaw-dropping. The set up-(pilot show) was a little slow, but that was to be expected as it laid out all the character backgrounds, story lines, etc.  The characters are deliciously complex.  The acting is superb.  I feel like I am being thrown right into the middle of the action with every episode.  It's one of the best shows I've seen- it is engrossing- I would highly recommend and would also HIGHLY recommend/suggest/REQUIRE that your young kids are SOUND asleep when you start watching this one!

  I wasn't sure what to expect when I first purchased this television series. I heard a lot about it from a few friends, and since I don't have time to watch a lot of television during the week. So I decided I'd watch it when I could, only problem was. When I started watching it, I couldn't stop it was that good, and I was totally hooked on the series and bought the rest of the series. I would definitely recommend this series to everyone who wants a heart pounding experience.

"
  I had never seen it but had heard good things so for $10 I figured why not give it a shot? Holy crap, what a great purchase! Turns out to be one of the greatest shows of all time and now I can watch it whenever I want. Major score!

"
  Watch this when you have time to binge watch all the season.  Yes, it’s that good. So prepare yourself.  No children, no young teenagers.

  The disc came perfectly as described. The only problem I had with my order was the box that season 1 of breaking bad came in the top left corner of it was damaged and Benton other than that everything was as described and in great condition.

"
  I didn't catch ""Breaking Bad"" from the beginning and I regret my decision.  Of course, on the other hand if I had watched from the beginning I would have been addicted for my weekly fix. I've watched ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire"" and consider them to be two of the greatest TV series of all time.  ""Breaking Bad"" is in the same class as those other two.  Thank goodness that AMC decided to show these again from the beginning. People like me now have an opportunity to catch up on all the ""Badness"".

"
  I heard about this on a radio broadcast I like to listen to and they were talking about how great the series was, made it sound interesting. I had trouble making it to the end of the first show on the first disc (last time I take their advice on what to watch). Glad I bought it used, the object was described as ""Used-Very Good' and filled by Amazon, The description of the used discs was perfect, the discs worked fine.

  Ok,let me start by saying this isn't the type tv show I would have ever thought would be for me,but have had so many people telling me how good it is,thought I would give the first season a try.And now have all of the seasons available,and waiting on the new,and sadly last,season to start.This show is so well written,that I rate it among walking dead,and sons of anarchy,not for the young or squeamish however. The actors are all pros, not only the main characters,but the guests also. If you are a lover of great television,this will be a classic!
",5
"
  I didn't think we'd like this show due to the story premise, but the characters are immensely interesting. And, to me it doesn't promote drug use and instead shows how Meth ruins lives - while promoting the importance of paying attention in school especially when it comes to learning Science and Chemistry. As we learned from Einstein - science can create good things and bad things. So, pay attention in school and don't do drugs. You're likely to be a happy, successful person one day. You get to see two very different ""worlds"" in this show.

"
  Outstanding writing, acting, direction, and story line! Very rare series...However, plentiful violence and some nudity make it a VERY adult-oriented show. Be warned.
",5
"
  I've been a fan of Breaking Bad for years. Season One is a classic and should be in everyone's home video library.Season One, episode one is brilliant and the writing, cinemaphotography, plot line, characters, etc. is one of the best pieces of filmmaking in the business. It's that good.
",5
"
  Fabulous show.  Easily one of the best shows written for television.  I highly recommend it.  It gets better and better with each episode.  The acting is wonderful and the writing is outstanding.  It will be hard to stop watching for you will find yourself eager to watch the next episode. My favorite show of all time.
",5
"
  After reading many reviews and seeing this blu-ray on sale, I decided to see what all the hype is about.  The show simply captured me from the first episode and I haven't been able to get enough.  My wife and I both are just engrossed with this show and can't wait for each new episode.  Breaking Bad is definitely one of the best shows on television and if it keeps the current pace, could go down as one of the best dramas of all time.  One a side note, if you do not like the first season, you most likely won't like the following seasons so if you are thinking about purchasing the seasons, start off by buying season 1 only and then go from there.
",5
"
  Ok ok, the quote is from the final season, But cmon. This show is the most badass thing ever made. After watching the first season, it became available on netflix and I pretty much never left my house until I finished them all. Bryan Cranston shows just how amazing of an actor he is without overdoing a single line. There's not much more to say about this show, and this season, other than just to go for it and watch it. You won't be disappointed.
",5
"
  Wow.  This family gets involved in a series of terrible decisions.  I find the pattern of behavior very disturbing.  Nonetheless, the acting, writing and directing make this an addictive series.  It is very satisfying to watch from a story-telling standpoint.  The plot draws me in.  My wife gives it 5 stars and I give it 4.  I really, really like the production of this show but, beating the dead horse, find the subject matter disturbing.

  In a country of over 310 million, there are hundreds of people every day who find out that they have cancer or some other terminal condition.  Some face their conditions heroically, and most others manage to at least view their situation with resignation.  Probably very few truly ""break bad"" as a means to secure their families' futures after they are gone.This DVD set contains all seven episodes of the first (2008) season of the AMC series ""Breaking Bad,"" a drama in which Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling Albuquerque high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, produces methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) as a means of providing financial security for his family before he dies.Cranston and Paul have each won Emmys for their gritty portrayals of two who have gone utterly wrong.  The series shows the unsavory characters Walt is forced to deal with after his descent into crime, the psychological and health morass into which he progressively sinks, his continuing moral struggles after he gets involved, the harrowing effects of meth use on those who take it, and the consequences that crime inflicts on innocent people.  Walter and Jesse end up sinking deeper into crime and lies than they ever thought they'd get.Anna Gunn plays Skyler, Walter's unsuspecting wife.  There are intense scenes showing family decisions about cancer and the choices that many such families are forced to consider in real life, as well as scenes that graphically show cancer's effects.""Breaking Bad"" has been nominated three times for the Outstanding Drama Series Emmy.  The series has great shots of the New Mexico desert, there are even a few funny moments in the series, and this DVD set contains bonus features on how the series was made.  ""Breaking Bad"" is definitely not a feel-good series, but its no-holds-barred portrayal of the depths to which flawed humanity is capable of falling has garnered the show many viewers and Emmy nominations.

  Not only was the Series Great. But the Condition of this DVD is Excellent & received this within a very reasonable period of time.

  I am viewing the first season again, first time 3 years ago.  The nuanced writing and sense of desperation provided in Walter White's character are revealed in today's society and cause people to elevate a show of this nature.  It is quite a political and ethical topic in which as individuals we question whether we try to justify family and fore go societal mores.  The lies and deceit are something we ask ourselves in everyday life, are they justifiable?  This program exemplifies all our societal issues across the spectrum and asks the viewer, what would you do or which character do you identify with?  It is brilliant writing and acting.
",5
"
  Great show. Went to re watch the series on DVD & couldn't find season 1. Decent price but forgot there are only 7 episodes in the first season.
",5
"
  This opening season of the series sets the tone for the series. It's at least as dark as The Soprano's was, but set in a very different world. Sort of like watching a slow motion train wreck that keeps escaping the final cataclysmic and devastatingly ultimate conclusion. They keep lurching from situation to situation, from lie to lie and getting away with it. It's very dark, very human, plausible and human. I'm really hooked.
",5
"
  I never watched this show while it was on TV.  I am so happy I gave it a chance now. It is far better than I thought it would be. I knew the basic premise, but the show really grabs hold of you with all the characters' back stories. I've been binge watching it since starting it, and everyone I've spoken to about this show who's seen it feels the same way.
",5
"
  1. I don't watch ""fiction"" TV2. Have read and heard about this show but didn't even realize that we get it (I'm still pretty much ABC, CBS, NBC, HGTV, DIY, etc.)3. Watched in my Kindle Fire -- and I was surprised how crisp the video was4. Is a refreshing break from the 'mysteries' my spouse tends to watch (Criminal Minds, Cold Case, etc.)5. If you haven't seen it, try it. I'll watch a few more -- but I think I might be on to something here.
",5
"
  Dark and depressing for my taste. Did not live up to the hype for me.

"
  I love this storyline and look forward to getting and watching the second season.  In this season Walter is a pushover for anyone.  Even his wife thinks that he is weak and she constantly wants him to open up and take charge of his life.  Walter has secretly taken over his life and it becomes evident that not even cancer will keep him down.  He loves his wife and son and will do whatever it takes to protect them.  He finds what he needs with Jesse, even if it means breaking bad.
",5
"
  Power programming. Rebelling against everything you ever thought was ""the right thing to do"" because when you're desperate enough, and you've just had enough, and you've got nothing to lose - you just don't care any more. We know he's doing wrong things but some part of our inner psyche is with him, we feel for him, we empathize. I will be watching all episodes/all seasons now. After watching just the first episode of the first season, I was hooked.
",5
"
  I realize this is just my opinion but this is thus far my favorite season of Breaking Bad (I have yet to see season 5).The pacing was perfect, the relationship between Walt and Pinkman is perfect, the arc is perfect.I can find basically nothing about this season that I didn't like. Perhaps the sister-in-law.I can make no promises for the rest of the show (though if you are a living human you will likely love it) but this first season is absolutely stellar.
",5
"
  Oh my gosh, this series is fantastic. Addicting. Well-cast, great directing, and everything gels. Not too often do you get a perfect cast; Breaking Bad characters are all viable, believable and you think, which one could be taken out of the show? None of them... each character adds to this series. Bought this as a gift for my step-father, can't wait to give it to him. And, for each holiday and birthday will add the next season.Fun to find a clever, well-acted, well-written series that moves along fast. Excellent.
",5
"
  What's all the hub-bub about?!  Yup, now I get it... This show is well-scripted with amazing cinematography and attention to detail.  It sucks you right in and hold you there episode after episode after episode...But hey it's already 2015, so you probably already knew that.  I feel like the last guy on earth to have found this show.... I dont even really watch TV but I never can wait for an available moment to sneek in one more episode.

  I had just about given up on television when a friend suggested Breaking Bad.  He said that the actor from Malcolm in the middle plays a teacher turned Meth cook. I remember thinking to myself, ""really?"", it didn't sound very watchable.  I pretty much gave it 5 episodes to hook me.A month later I have watched almost every episode and I am about to start watching the last season that I have saved on my DVR.  It is a GREAT show.  Bryan Cranston is fantastic and the story is like a book you can't put down.See this!
",5
"
  At first I thought, a show about a meth dealer?  NOT FOR ME!  My 19 year old daughter forced us to watch one episode and we were hooked - spent our entire vacation at the beach watching all four seasons!  Season 5 is the series finale - can't wait - I just wish these cable shows would have a 20-22 season run and not 10-11 - way too short and too long a wait for the next season!  Come on HBO, SHO, AMC - you can play with the big boys - this is an award winning series and NOW I KNOW WHY!  Once you have met Walt, there is a little of him in most of us.
",5
"
  Simply the greatest TV show ever produced.  It is worth watching and re-watching over and over again to see the transformation of Walter White from a cancer stricken chemistry teacher into a drug kingpin with unchecked narcississim.The acting is top-notch across the board.  The characters are deep and layered and the situations they get into are completely screwed up.  You will find yourself binge watching this show - 2 or 3 episodes a night until it is complete.
",5
"
  This season was recommended to us by a friend.  The first season was super slow but we decides to continue watching. We ended up loving the season.  Really  glad we didn't give up on this season after the first one. The first season gives you the background  of all the characters and really plays an important part to the series. Watch it. You won't be sorry!!!

"
  I had never seen this show on TV before I got the season on DVD so I wasn't really sure what to expect. It turned out to be one of the most original and well put together shows I have ever seen. Normally when I watch movies I play on the computer and whatnot but this show captivated me to the point that I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. The writing is excellent, the characters are well developed even in the first season, and the plot takes so many hilarious, morbid and terribly bizarre (yet believable) turns that you can't help but be completely absorbed.
",5
"
  I've heard from a few different friends on how great this show is, but I've never seen it before a few weeks ago. I burned through the first season in about 2 days (There are only 7 or 8 episodes). Yep, I was hooked. Purchased seasons 2, 3, and 4 soon after. Then I bought the first half of Season 5 on Amazon Video on Demand. I'm all caught up now and can't wait until the conclusion to the series next summer. Very highly recommended show and worth every penny. I haven't seen the special features so that will give me something to watch while I wait.
",5
"
  As my son put it, the story is something Shakespeare might have written had he been born today.This series takes full advantage of the cable TV media where viewing time is no longer cut into 10-15 minute segments for commercial breaks and the story in the script can cross over the weekly show. Characters are complex and identifiable to anyone.I started to watch because the Economist said that watching six seasons of Breaking Bad can teach as much about business and human aspects of any entrepreneurial start up, not just the meth business, as a Harvard MBA! I take recommendations by the Economist seriously. Even if you are not interested in an MBA, it is a superbly entertaining show.

  Friends at work were making a lot of Breaking Bad references and I've been wanting to binge-watch a quality series for a couple months.  So I bought the season and watched the episodes.  It's a well produced show.  I have to admit that I fast-forwarded through the chemo sessions.It was good enough that I also bought the second season.  It quickly devolved into a soap opera so not sure that I'll see it through.

  Very fast service. Item exactly as described. Highly recommend.

  We don't watch TV, have no service but we do love watching movies and old TV shows. Everyone kept asking if we had seen this set so I bought it for my husband for Christmas. It has been hard to watch an episode at a time, we just wanted to gobble it up in one sitting. We have always loved Bryan Cranston, (used to watch Malcolm in the middle) and so we were blown away by this actor's growth- he is just wonderful. I don't like violent movies or TV shows, so this only works for me because of the humor and wit..really good series.

"
  I bought this for my dad for Fathers Day. I have already seen all the seasons and love it. This show is simply the best. I love the drama and suspense. The actors really played their parts very well, especially Saul! I can't stop recommending this show to people. My dad has told me that also likes the show. Now I have to get him the rest of the seasons for this brithday coming up.
",5
"
  I just started watching this show and withing a couple of weeks have already watched through season 4. You really need to start on the first show and watch them in order. I don't think they make good stand alone shows. The writing is fantastic by bringing in many ""issues"" that most married family men will relate to while having plenty of dark fiction to make it the modern day Godfather. It is very good, although, dark. But be careful. Once you start, it's hard to stop.
",5
"
  I saw the first show/pilot and was hooked.  Went ahead and ordered the whole first season.  I don't regret it.  we watched the first season in about 3 days.  It is one of those shows, that if you like it, it is very addictive.  Characters are extremely well developed and played by the actors.  If you liked complex, well developed character shows that are a bit absurd (ie., Six feet under, Deadwood, the Sopranos), then you will really like this series.  we are now on Amazon on demand, Season two of the show
",5
"
  This season was highly recommended by a friend. Purchased season 1 through amazon.com, watched all episodes back to back. Immediately following, we purchased season 2 & 3 over amazon.com instant play and my husband and I watched 20 episodes back to back over the weekend... we literally couldn't STOP! Exceptional drama; gripping, intelligent,highly suspenseful and addicting to watch! So many, ""HOLY COW - did that really just happen??"" moments.  We are astonished that we have never heard about this series before.  Highly recommended.

  Story, characters,  acting, production, cinematography, all were a 10.  This will be the bar for all serious production companies to strive for.

  This show, for me, was the best series television I have ever watched.  Perhaps like crystal meth, terribly addictive (I don't know).situations, everything worked perfectly in my opinion.  I was not thrilled by the finale, but it did resolve some questions, and included Anna Gunn, which was important to me.  I wouldn't know where to begin in listing my favorite plotlines or episodes, but all of it is etched indelibly in my mind. Just an amazingly entertaining series.
",5
"
  Wow, my husband and I were PLEASANTLY surprised at this tv series.  It was a bit depressing in parts but full of action and humor sprinkled throughout.  It is well written and directed. You find yourself thinking about morality and ""what would you do"" in the different scenarios. You are mad at the characters one minute and sympathetic the next minute.  Just as a FYI for those concerned, it does have cursing and is a bit dark but it is definitely worth checking out if you don't mind that.  A++++++
",5
"
  I wanted to learn what all the fuss is about, especially because it's now in its 5th season. I was not disappointed. Not only was there plenty of suspense/action but also well crafted character development containing keen observations of conditions leading to and explaining his fateful decision to break bad. Problem with instant streaming: occasionally the action paused to allow more video to load. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, so will investigate before purchasing more.

"
  One of the Best Dramas in the history of television... if only they had decided to do a better transfer of the video... poor job, but the show itself negates that. It was pretty sad that the AMC aired version looked so much better.

"
  I see why this series won the Emmy award.  The story is gripping, and so full of surprises and unexpected events, you never know what will come next.  But, it is believable.  The characters are fully developed, and you feel like you could know them in real life.  Also, it provides a look into a world many of us will never see first hand (thank goodness!).  We're just about done with season 2 and looking forward to starting season 3.
",5
"
  This show amazed and surprised me. People whose taste in good drama I respect kept recommending it to me. I am so happy that I finally relented. This is an extraordinary series. The development of the characters and the amazing scripts leave you breathless. I don't think I've ever seen anything as gritty as this is pull off being so funny at the same time. A real must see.

"
  ""Mad Men"" is great and I've watched three seasons of it, but ""Breaking Bad"" is phenomenal (and I've only just gotten started).  In fact, this could be one of the best shows ever.  Seven fantastic episodes kicked off by the pilot-to-end-all-pilots.  The only lull in the season is when Walter White's family has a long intervention with him about why he doesn't want to get chemotherapy.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad scene, but it's blown away by every other scene in the show.  Bryan Cranston does a great job, as usual.

  A very good friend of mine got me into watching this series at the end of the fourth season.  The twists and turns that this series has too offer were great, like being on a roller coaster.  It did take me a few shows to get the story straight as well as the characters then I was hooked and had to purchase seasons 1, 2 & 3.  My friend even traveled an hour to do a season marathon......lol.As great as this series is as you watch it you think to yourself how easily this could happen in real life.

  Good writing and excellent casting create a refreshing series full of entertainment. The show potrays the transformation of a terminal cancer diagnosis on nice-guy high school chemistry teacher Walt. Walt is a family man who puts all his energy into supporting his pregnant wife and teenage son. As the series progresses we learn that this mild-mannered diffident man has hidden brilliance and that he contributed to Nobel award winning research when he was a post-graduate student.Walt's approach to his life transforms with the sudden diagnosis of terminal cancer. His priority becomes making enough money to keep his family comfortable when he is gone. He gets the idea to make methamphetamine when he sees the fat stacks of cash on a televised raid on a local lab. Serendipitously Walt learns that a former student, Jesse-- now known in the drug underworld as ""Captain Cook"", is involved in the manufacture and sale of meth. Walt coerces Jesse, a hapless and rather pathetic wanna-be gansta, into becoming his partner in crime. Drug manufacturing brings out Walt's genius at chemistry and he creates an exceptionally fine high-demand product. But the violent and predatory nature of the local drug distributors require a matching violent and dominant aspect of Walt's personality to emerge. The corrupt and unsavory nature of the drug underworld forces Walt to kill or be killed.Bryan Cranston makes the show with his talent for comedy, both subtle and slapstick, and his sensitive  portrayal of tragedy. Impending death creates a complex set of demands and transformations for Walt that Cranston manages with apparent ease. The excellent supporting cast fulfill the promise of a well-written script and good direction. The twelve episodes of this series leaves you wanting more. Highly recommended!

  For frequent flyers, Breaking Bad is an ideal airplane video series. I fly a lot ... watching TV series in the long sittings are ideal time killers.The Breaking Bad premise is `geek meets mortality'. For the time remaining in this world, the dying geek's choices are fundamentally defective. His choices break worse and consume all around him. Thin is the line between good, bad, and well intentioned.The show is slow by episode. The series can be enjoyed in the full season viewing.

  If the first ten minutes of S1E1 of this show don't immediately hook you and gain your interest, just give up:  it's not for you.  There are reasons that Bryan Cranston won so many Emmy awards for 'Best Actor.'  Watch this show to see why.  The show-runner, Vince Gilligan, used to write for the X Files, and he and his team of writers really know how to pace a show.  This program is right up there with the best television shows of all time.

  I never would have thought I would like a quirky series about a high school chemistry teacher who gets into ""cooking"" crystal meth. but I love this series and plan to buy all the later episodes.  As in all great shows (Sopranos, Mad Men, etc.), the acting, down to the smallest roles, is superb and the viewer has to bring something to it. I look forward to all the twists and turns of the episodes to come.

  Others have reviewed this show and mentioned that the writing and acting are so exemplary that it makes it difficult to watch other shows.  I concur.  The level of writing and acting is nuanced and layered and OH so believable.  The actors are obviously enjoying the tremendous material they have been given as it must be rewarding to use your talents so completely and deeply.  I am saddened that the show is almost done.  I NEVER but TV shows.  It's TV for goodness sake!  But, I buy these because it is better to watch this show without commercials as you would a movie.  I refuse to watch the last season that is on now so that I can buy it later.  Yes, it is that good.  Believe it or not, it gets better too!

  I couldn't stop watching it was so good. I watched all 5 seasons in 2 weeks!  There are many layers to this. The weak husband weakened by a diagnosis of cancer and also weakened by a squashing wife gains strength in cooking meth to make money in order to support his family when he dies. The character rises to overcome many adversities and struggles with what he is doing making unlikely friendships and distancing ones that are close. Beautiful.

  It's been a running joke that my college student majored in chemistry after being inspired by this series, so that she can pay off college loans after graduation.  Season One came for Crristmas...Season Two for birthday... Season three will be a spring break treat.  Passed those midterm exams and got past the worst of the cold, slushy, tromping around campus yuck part.

  The first season was SO breathtaking I decided to purchase the DVD set. I know some of the episodes were repeated later before the start of the second season but my son and I now own all the seasons on DVD so we can enjoy it all over again in a few years. I also loaned this out to friends who never saw it so they could get hooked and watch the remaining seasons. This is the only show on tv I have ever made sure not to miss each week. LOVE IT!

  Best show on TV ever except maybe The Shield.  Maybe!  If you get this DVD, and the ensuing seasons, I hope your microwave works and your girlfriend isn't horny, and your lawn doesn't need mowing or your pool need cleaning, because the only thing you're going to do that entire damn weekend is watch this DVD.  Hope your favorite food place delivers because this show is better than porn.  Once you hit play, nothing else will matter.  Great, great television show; one of the best ever.  I'll miss it dearly when they bring it to an end.  And I'll pre-order the next seasons.

  What can you say? I have been a fan from the beginning. I loved the show. This First Season has Walter White, mild mannered chemistry teacher and family man. He has lung cancer and isn't given much time. Walter White begins to die to be replaced by the more evil Heisenberg later. We are drawn into the process and can't take our eyes off! I loved watching and will miss the show.

  I've heard about this series, so I decided to buy it, without ever watching an episode.  I was hooked after the first episode!  Bryan is especially good as Walter White, a struggling chemist, who just needs a break in life.  His sidekick, Aaron Paul, does a great job as Jesse White, a young thug who is sort of clueless, yet has street smarts.  They balance each other out.  Very interesting concept for a show and excellent execution.  The whole cast is good.  Buy it or watch it, you won't be disappointed.  I watched the first season in a day.  I bought the second season and watched the day I bought it also.  I'm buying all seasons of this show.  I love it!!!

  The entire show is ver well done.  It has a great cast.  I was not expecting something like this, I thought Bryan Cranston was great in Malcom and always thought of hime as a commedian.  This isn't Malcom and Bryan Cranston is excellent in this show. Season 1 and 2 were on sale and I thought that I sould just purchase season 1, in case it was like the Pacific, not very good.  I should have purchased season 2.  I will an Season 3 also. Well worth watching.

  The first season starts off a little slow, but you will be hooked by the end of it. I think this is one of the best-written TV series of all time. I thoroughly enjoyed getting sucked into the increasingly crazy and dark world of Walter White as he delves into the world of making crystal meth in order to pay his medical bills and leave a nest egg for his family after learning he has cancer in the first episode. If you enjoy good storytelling, you will love this show!

  If you've seen this series, you want to have the DVD for EACH season.  Once it's no longer on the air, you will NEED to have the DVD's to turn to.  The series is even more addictive than the product Walter White made.  Season One is the beginning of an amazing journey for Walt, Skyler, R.J., Jesse, Hank and Marie -- you don't want to miss out on a minute of it!

  Had no idea what was all the commotion regarding this show.  had never seen it.  Wow! Trying to watch only 1 episode a night so I don't get to the end too quickly, but failing miserably.  Can't get enough.  I'll be purchasing all the other seasons as well.  My husband is also 2 thumbs up!  Great

  This is my first experience with Amazon's Instant Videos.  I bought the 1st season of Breaking Bad in HD and streamed it with a Panasonic Blu-ray player, connected via Ethernet and HDMI to my home theater system.  I love the character development in this show.  I missed Breaking Bad when it was broadcast on AMC, but now I'm thoroughly hooked!  One more reason to love Amazon.
",5
"
  I've started watching this Breaking Bad series only years after the first episode had already aired. Boy were we in for a surprise when we started watching the first episode. And then another and another.. We've watched the entire first two seasons in one weekend. For me this was a must have on the highest commercial HD-resolution disc out there, Blu-ray, hands down. Ordered first three seasons for a despicable great price, right here on Amazon. Even after import-duties it was still a catch (I'm from Europe). All characters in this great series are likeable except for Skyler maybe. i Just cannot get into her irrational moodswings and motivations. Then again I feel the actress who is playing Skyler still does an excellent job, because it looks pretty real.

  The best way to introduce the fam to Walter White.

  We've absolutely loved watching this series. Not only is it entertaining, so many of the themes explored make for great dinnertime discussion. I've loved discussion the moral issues raised with my wife as we progress through the season. Because of the very real, graphic nature of these issues, this is a series suited for adults and probably not kids.
",5
"
  As an older person I did not expect to like a series featuring drugs.  However I found it quite funny and at the same time poignant.  Perhaps because I viewed it on my Kindle the violent scenes were not that vivid for me.  At the least I would say it's a unique story that has held my interest enough to go on to season 2.

  It took me awhile to even WANT to watch this show but was talked into it.  Some of the content isn't ""me"" but I found I kept wanting to watch it to see what was going to happen next. It was like a book where you wanted "" to just keep reading!""..... There are some really violent / gross parts - I just turn my head - its not stopping me from watching!

  Wanted to introduce my mom to the AMAZING show that is Breaking Bad and while I have Netflix and could watch it there. My mother is hispanic and speaks little English.

  The begining of the GREATEST show in the history of television!

  I've watched this series from beginning to end. Obviously this is where it begins. The only show that kept me wondering from start to finish of every episode what was going to happen next. It was completely unpredictable, and most of the time something opposite, but just as satisfying would happen. I'm glad to own this. Not to mention that watching the behind the scenes stuff is really good too.

  You either love it or you hate it. If you're not hooked by episode three, give it away...""Breaking Bad's"" not everyone's cup of blue crystal meth. Those first ones are as good as it gets on the tube. It's the TV series that jumps out light years above the rest. For home programming, this is the show by which all others will be measured from now own. Soon it will air its last Season Five finale episodes. Catch up...quick! Just do it!
",5
"
  Obviously since this has been one of the biggest hits of our culture in quite some time, I can't say much more then what that already says for the show. From the very first episode this series sucked me in and I couldn't get enough of Walter White. Thank goodness for Netflix where I was able to satisfy my feeding frenzy at record pace.

  Do I really need to explain?  Breaking Bad is one of the best things to happen to TV since.... The Wire.  Six Feet Under.  The Sopranos.  The Shield.  So much great story telling and acting and writing going on here that it's impossible to review, really.  And I am not the spoiling kind, so you won't get any reveals from me here!

  My husband really enjoyed this.  But the sequels increase in price each time and unless there's absolutely nothing to watch or do, just won't pay when I already purchase so much with prime.

  This is what  got started making me a fan of the series.  I liked what  I saw in the first season and decided that I wanted to watch even more. As I write this review, I have seen all of seaason two too.  I look further to watching season 3  to 6.I liked it a lot.

  My husband and I recently watched ""Breaking Bad, Season 1"" and LOVED it--couldn't wait to get to the next episode and I've already ordered season 2. It has dark, comedic, even warped elements to a pretty darned interesting story line. I would say if you like unusual drama and humor, give season 1 a try and see what you think.

  Great series. Get this season one as a sampler. If you like it buy the entire series with all episodes. It is that good!

  Desperation drives us to do unthinkable things.  Fear and anger do the same.  The rest of us love to see what one man does to solve the still-solvable problems that face him, as his cancer diagnosis seals HIS fate.  At least he feels in control of something.  And his solution is money.  It proves once again that we can't judge a book by its cover.

  I never felt interested to watch this show on my own, until my husband told me a little about it. I watched this first episode and I was like ""Wow! Now that's good acting!"" the whole series just kept my attention. The characters were very well animated and I loved how there was a lot of drama, but quite a bit of side humor as well!

  Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, ""Sure, Mom!"" like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and snap back at parents who ask them to do it. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believable.3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house-case over.4. At Tio's when Tuco throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over. When there is a death like Tuco’s, law enforcement workers search miles around the crime scene.5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman/man  on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers. Gilligan shows that he is writing about how he thinks it goes in schools, not how it truly works.7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believable.10. Hank would have not only driven by the laundry once, he would have been driving by several times and he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night, and sent others to do the same.11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant. The DEA agents would have noticed one of their own acting suspiciously.17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. DNA does not go anywhere. Also, the magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there would be enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed. All hospitals film everyone coming and going because of having narcotics present in the facilities.20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.28. Once Skyler found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.29. They can pay $800,000 cash for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????30. Walt would have been traveling to the Cayman islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.31. Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skyler. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, ""Diamonds, that will shut her up.""35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat in New Mexico with heat in the 100's to 110's?36. Skyler would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.38. The police are portrayed as bumbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believable that no police officer can put two and two together.39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Junior. No one gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. case closed40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have done so in order to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. Pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle or even look dirty. Not believable.45. Too many bullets fly in the shooting scenes. My brothers both use automatic weapons and I know plenty of law enforcement officials who tell me that when the bullets fly from an automatic rifle, someone dies. Oh, Hank falls to the ground as his defense against automatic weapon fire. Hank would be dead. He would have been hit with many bullets and his head would explode like a watermelon bursting open.46. Too many dead bodies and no one seems to be missing them. Too many ways both Walt and Jesse would have been seen with the ones they killed. All cities have cameras on the streets. All major roads have ""eye in the sky"" cameras. When people die, relatives know who the last person is that was with them.47. All in all, too many things just are not believable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.

  Breaking Bad is an intense story of getting caught facing tha harsh realities of two opposing worlds. You can literally feel the tension in trying to keep the worlds from colliding or crashing down. The emotions of the moment are conveyed with crystal clarity.

  It is almost difficult to put into words what makes Breaking Bad such a hilarious an riveting show. The seriousness of the subject material with the real-world personalities of the characters with the perfect spice of humor in places. The Blu-ray pack has two discs for the season, quality is great and sound is crisp, extras are great, could use more commentary but some behind the scenes videos make it worthwhile to spend more time with the discs than the episodes offer.

  Best show ever

  I finally got around to watching this series just as it was ending, and watched seasons 1-5 in a 3-day marathon (maybe a bit too intense?) Of course, it's as good as my sister kept telling me. Superb acting by all, and very fast pacing.

  We were encouraged to watch Breaking Bad by several friends, but just never got around to it until we ordered from Amazon around the holidays. We received our order in a timely manner, all in one piece. Then, we started to watch and could not get our eyes off it!! Excellent program. You have to be open-minded to watch it and I would not say this is material for kids, but if you really watch closely, then watch again, you pick up a lot from the interactions in the series. Great acting!Thanks!

  After recently learning about what I have been missing for several years on AMC, thanks to my son, I--apparently--purchased the first season of Breaking Bad. Anyway, I am glad I have finally discovered this jewel. I never gave a thought to how Tony Soprano became a gangster because it was his family's business. Walter White is the polar opposite, so we get to watch as Everyman goes bad. Neat concept and IMHO immensely well done. Since I discovered I was not peculiar for having a very active imagination after reading ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" when I was a kid, I have enjoyed many of the stories and  movies based on characters who break away from the mundane to right a wrong or to address some pressing societal need. Walter White makes it personal and real.It is not an important spoiler alert for me to point out the beautifully written and brilliantly acted scene where Walter's family has an intervention with him to sincerely urge him to have aggressive cancer treatment with only the audience knowing that this timid but thoughtful man has already made and sold street drugs, murdered two men, and destroyed the shiny car of a jerk. Now that's a story you can get your teeth into! I will certainly be renting/buying the rest of the seasons.
",5
"
  Lots of yadda yadda about this in the paper and among some friends. We had to try it. It was surprisingly engrossing and human despite the fact I wish all real meth dealers would just die. The plot and characters are compelling. If you want something different, this is a good place to start. Has a real ""Dexter"" feel to it.
",5
"
  This is a dark drama ala ""Dexter,"" but darker yet.  Bryan Cranston and cast are outstanding! The viewer is immediately introduced to the grim premise which is explained well.  Cranston's character makes implausible decision after another for a man with his education. Nevertheless, the bizarre route that the character chooses to resolve his troubles does not over-shadow the plot. Without those decisions, there would not be this wildly creative show.  If you appreciate sardonic comedy, great acting, and plot twists, you will enjoy ""Breaking Bad.""I have ordered the remaining seasons.
",5
"
  Excellent series, character dynamics, and just an overall great show. Storyline is supurb and the entire series is extremely well done :). Very entertaining from beginning to end! Not for people that are sensitive to language or some violence but it's easily overlooked because the show is so well done.

  I had already seen the entire series, thanks to Netflix streaming, but a friend had not seen it and does not subscribe to Netflix.  I purchased this for a Xmas gift because it's hands down one of the best writing, action and acting that I have ever seen.  It's addictive to watch and even the photography is classic and superb.

  I love this show, it was recommended to me by a friend so I purchased the 1st and 2nd seasons, I'm almost done, it is a fabulous crazy show, but the acting is top notch, it keeps your interests.UPDATE, I'm now watching Season Three, I also purchased Season FOUR, I am definately hooked on this bizarre show.  I LOVE IT, the acting is fabulous and so are the characters.

  One of my all-time favorite shows bar none. The acting in this series rivals anything I have ever seen movies included. I dare you not to get hooked on the show. When the series ended it saddened me. This is one show that took priority over everything else. Re-watching it here on Amazon was a blast and the quality is great too!
",5
"
  After the first ten minutes of the first episode of ""Breaking Bad,"" I was confused. But from then on the plot unfolded with a bang. It is so well-written with plenty of twists and turns, with mixed-in drama and humor, that I was hooked. Every character is perfectly cast and played. I couldn't believe that Bryan Cranston was the same man who played the idiot father in ""Malcolm in the Middle."" Each episode has its own mini-plot, often seemingly unsolvable.My only criticism is that there are only seven episodes per season.

  My son told me about this program. I had never heard of it until its recent publicity and my sons encouragement to watch the series. We have only just started and are only up to chapter 3 of season 1. This is a great show in the ilk of The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire Ray Donovan and Homeland. We are looking forward to watching the entire five seasons!

  I already owned the series from a few years ago. A friend mentioned she wanted to see it. I gave it to her as a Christmas present. She texted back that they ""binge"" watched it all the way through. I can't speak to the technical quality, but I assume it was fine because she didn't mention it.
",5
"
  I admit, I only started watching this show just recently, and after catching up, I got to say, ONE HECK OF A SHOW! Watching this showing has gotten me hooked! I mean literally, this show just keeps getting more and more intense every season! I just don't get it how a show like this is just so brutally intense! I just don't know. As far as characters go, fantastic! Just absolutely fantastic, especially Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White. He is the real deal! He is Heisenberg and I will definitely remember his name. As far the previous two episodes ""Blood Money"" and ""Buried"", it's a different type of intense. It's more of a dramatic intense rather than the disturbing images that you've seen in previous episodes. But still, it's Breaking Bad at its best. Overall, one of the best shows on TV.
",5
"
  The entire series was 'news' to me when AMC gave us a little preview after walking dead. I was hooked. This series is intriguing, life-like, a little action without being over the top. Each character brings an interesting importance. I can't believe the show has been on air since 2008--where was  I?????????????
",5
"
  This series is genius.  Every character is so well developed and I find myself feeling empathy, shock, anger, and affection for Walt and his family and all of his new ""acquaintances"".  I'm so happy I bought the series and I find myself watching two or three episodes in one sitting when I have the time.  This is a superb series so unlike anything else.

  I ordered this because I have been hearing all the hype about the Breaking Bad series.  I new nothing about the series except that many people are saying that it was an excellent series.  I have to say I was happily surprised.  I am looking forward to ordering the complete series and sharing this season 1 with my friends.

  As good as TV drama gets-- better than most movies. Hated to see it end. Lots of interesting characters each with individual issues. Not a series for the squeamish-- some graphic violence and lots of tense moments. Acting, direction, screenplay all first rate. I'll be watching it again soon.

  What can you say? EXCELLENT entertainment and acting.  I'm a fan. This is always a truly entertaining  series when you have friends over that want to watch something a bit strange and out of the ordinary!  It is really one of a kind series with a gut busting story line.  What's not to like with this series.  It's addictive (pun intended).

  A great introduction to how a good man goes bad. You can really feel for the lead character who has a tough job that does not pay enough to meet his obligations. He's kind of a wimp. By the end of the first show his wispiness has disappeared. You can decide if that is a good thing or not.

  My daughter received the whole series for christmas.

  LOVE this series! My husband and I  (both teachers, ironically enough) watched this entire series in one month. We couldn't wait to see what happened next. Now we're a little sad that it's over. In the entire series I think there were only about 2 episodes we didn't think were intense, amazing, outstanding! Highly recommend this!

"
  I cannot explain to someone who has not watched this series how excellent it is. I have watched each season over and over, and I never get sick of it. Walter Sr. and Jesse are characters that grab you and pull you into their lives, and you feel as if you are there with them. I am amazed every time I watch......

"
  You have to watch this series from the very beginning to see how a mild mannered chemistry teacher becomes the kingpin in meth cooking and dealing  It is so well written  You can't wait for the next show to see what happens and a whole lot happens  It is an amazing series

  AFTER WATCHING SOME OF THE LATER SHOWS I JUST HAD TO GO BACK TO  ITS START AND AS EXPECTED THIS ONE GRABS YOU RIGHT AWAY AND WONT LET YOU GO. ITS FIRST CLASS ACTING WRITING AND PHOTOGRAPHY . TV AT ITS VERY BEST. CANT WAIT FOR THE LAST EPISODES THIS AUGUST.

  If you can set aside moral objections regarding the production of meth, its distribution and resulting destruction in our society, it's excellently written and acted!

  Great show. Bryan Cranston and everyone else on the show are all professional and make this the series of a lifetime.

  For so long i heard about the Breaking Bad craze, but i never jumped on it. Now, i feel like kicking myself. I had to watch this episode for a class that i am taking in Media and i fell in love with the series. Now, i just have to buy the rest of them.It's a shame so many good shows leave TV and crappy ones take their place.

  The best acted best written program of all time. Nice combination. The epic story of a good man turned bad. You feel sympathetic to his plight and can imagine yourself making the same decisions during the first two seasons... after that the characters become darker adore self serving.
",5
"
  The product came in fine just alittle dents on the side but I'm fine with it. And if your looking to get the seasons of breaking bad for cheap definitely pick this one up
",5
"
  If you haven't started this show, then I feel sorry for you. It's so, so good. I don't want to give anything away. I think you need to just buy this DVD, ship it prime and when it arrives, take the day off of work and watch the first season. When you're done do the same thing with Season 2, etc. until you're caught up. You can thank me later.

  I had heard this was a good TV series.  The first series focuses on the characters and their roles.  Mr White & Jessie are an odd duo but it is comical in a different way.  It held my attention and I watched an episode every night !
",5
"
  I'm not going to say a lot about this because it's already been said. Just wanted to log my vote for this series as one of the all-time television greats, right up there with the Sopranos, NYPD Blue, The Wire and Homicide: Life on the Streets. And since this is the first season, this is where you've gotta get the ball rolling.

  I didn't realize AMC was running the BB Marathon this past weekend (09-27-13 thru 09-29-13) until the last 5 minutes of the second  episode!  Got the remaining 59 onto a DVR though!!!  My BB Marathon begins this weekend!  Can't wait!Regarding the video via Amazon!  Clarity was great on 22"" widescreen LCD monitor (PC) and sound was crisp and definitive were applicable!  Will view episode 2, ""Cat's in the Bag"",  using Amazon Instant Video as well!  Thanks Amazon!

  I was hooked with the the pilot episode and to my delight, it was all uphill from there.This storyline twists, turns and winds its way around characters and side plots you just won't see coming. Rarely did I imagine the collateral damage from one event onto another (seemingly) unrelated event or even how they could even be tied together.This what you get when great writing/cast/cinematography/editing are all combined. You will want to re-watch this a few times to absorb its rich detail.Often beautiful to look at, with characters we either love or hate. (Just take what happened to Anna Gunn who got quite a bit of hate mail (and worse) from her portrayal of Skyler White. She was so good as an actress that lots of people couldn't separate Anna from the character she played. Read her New York Times opinion at [...]This is what Must-See-TV really is.I still mourn the ending of the series.

  I just started watching this series after hearing all the hype and I am pleased with the series so far. It is worth all the hype and rave reviews. I finished season 1 in one sitting. I was only disappointed by the fact that it was only 7 episodes. I am already on season 3. Amazing show!

  Wow...I can't believe I never watched this series until after the finale.  I just finished this first season DVD and it is just...wow.  I'm totally addicted.  The story line is compelling and the acting is outstanding.  I seriously can't wait until I can start on Season two!

  This show is great. I am 34 and lately there hasn't been anything worth watching in a long time.  I watched season one in two days and I was immediately drawn from the pilot.  Jesse is a great character. He and walt grow and have the greatest relationship. What I love most about this show is that there is mild cursing meaning there isn't any ""F"" bomb.

  If you don't mind the graphic violence that goes along with drug dealing and crime, this is a riveting, extremely well written and performed drama series.  It contains several great human interest stories.  I beleive it deserves all of the awards it has received and more!  Warning: watching this series can be addictive.

  This series is much darker than I anticipated (was thinking it might be more like Weeds), but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting and writing are superior to many other shows. Reels you right in and keeps you hooked! I've already watched the first two seasons, and I am looking forward to starting the third! Excellent!

  Plays well in my MacBook Pro!  Loved the show and have been trying to catch up with it!  The show is in its last season and I will surely buy the rest!  The actors & acting is great!!  Sorry it took me so long to catch up to watching!

  I did not see this series from the beginning and only saw a few episodes.In itself, this pilot would be a masterpiece.The acting is too good to be true.Must see this from the first episode to gain a feel for the characters.Pure magic.

"
  This is hands down the best show in years.  I can't tell you how much you will enjoy the mis-adventures of this family and their brilliant slide into becoming sinister.  Some of the best acting I've seen in a long time - - I know why they've won all of those awards.  I'm hooked on it like the product they're selling.  Amazing.
",5

  I think the main reason I liked it so much is how unique it is. Too often a TV show, movie, or book comes out and you go ""This is just a knock off of [fill-in-the-blank]"". Not so with this.

"
  I never watched Breaking Bad when it was on television. Lucky for me, I now get to experience this great series most nights. The acting is top notch and the stories are intense and unique. After being blown away by this first great season, I purchased all of the seasons because I just have to know what happens next and how it all ends.
",5
"
  Very good, just way too short. There is a reason for only having several episodes though so I understand. Season 1 hooks your right from the start and wastes no time in the main character turning bad.

"
  Never wanted to see this show, as it was about drugs and things I no longer had any interest in, but near the end of season 5, eventually got the first season DVD, and was completely hooked.  The characterization and the storylines are awesome in an utterly realistic way, and the characters are as well.  Well worth your time...

  Best. Show. Ever.Keeps you on the edge of your seat from episode 1. Few artistic liberties, very ""real"" feel to it, great writing and acting on most everyone's part. This is what great TV is all about.

  Awesome show and Bryan Cranston makes this show his.  Unless he does something better I believe this is the show he will be remembered for.  I watched it four times.

  TV these days is full of mindless junk...Breaking Bad is one of those rare gems that you stumble upon by accident that leaves you feeling hopeful about television entertainment again.  Breaking Bad is a great concept: a terminally ill man's desire to leave his family with something after he's gone.  Bryan Cranston's character is by far one of the best ever created- an underachieving chemist who lives a bland life in middle class America- and played by a true artist of the acting craft.The first season left my husband and I speechless many times, while simultaneously shaking our heads in disbelief at what was playing out in front of us.  The plot in each episode has many twists and turns, almost always never what you anticipate.  We frequently raved to friends and family about this show, surprised that no one else seemed to either ""get it"" or know about it when it first debuted.  This underground hit has just finished its third season, which strongly ties to its first that lays the foundation to everything that has badly broken for Walt, Jesse, and their lives.

"
  If you love Dexter you will love this!!  I am hooked!  Gotta have it everyday!!!  I will be sad when I am on the last episode of the series!  Whoever does the writing for this they scare me.  How can you think of such things and then always get the characters out of the HUGE trouble they get in.

  I love it. One of the best shows I have ever seen. I love every character and I'm going to cry when it's all over. I hope Vince Gilligan will create another show as great as Breaking Bad. If you haven't seen it, get the first season, watch the first 3 episodes and I promise you'll be hooked.

  Enjoyed Breaking Bad very much. Felt it was the best series I have ever seen.

  Here we have the first season of BREAKING BAD.  It is amazing to realize that it is only 7 episodes for the character, plot and drama development is so thorough and realistic another show would need at least double the episodes to achieve it.  The basic plot is a teacher who finds out he is dying of cancer and thru unexpected situations gets the opportunity to make a great deal of money thru manufacturing meth.  He does so to make money for his family to be able to live on after he dies.  But the show is about so much more than this.  Every character is addicted to something and the introduction into the dark world of drugs is terrifyingly realistic.  This is honestly one of the best shows ever to air on television.  It tells a story that may be too dark for some to handle but the superb acting, writing and directing make it all work.  These characters are all believable, necessary and the intertwining of their lives is seamless.The show also succesfully combines deep psychological profiles of each character mixed with the heavy, often disturbing drama.  And the plot always serves a purpose, is realistic no matter how heavy, and is in no way gratuituous.  And with this show we also get one of the best duos ever in Walt and Jesse.  When Jesse, Aaron Paul, a former student of Walt, Bryan Cranston, joins him in the making of meth a perfect chemistry is formed.  BREAKING BAD also provides the occasional comic break that helps alleviate the heavy drama.  This series is a must for its great acting, superb writing and directing and totally unique premise.  If it sounds like any other series you have seen believe me when I say it is not.  The blu ray of course adds a dimension to the series over that of the dvd.  There are many dark scenes but the detail and clarity still shines thru and the scenes with color and specifically the lovely scenery shots pop off the screen.  Audio is superb.  This is  a series that is dialogue driven but when the action sequences happen nothing is held back.  This series is superb and I highly recommend it.

  After listening to all the reviews I had to buy great great amazing acting great actors this series will be around quite a while I've bought them all

  Brilliant.  This succeeds where ""Weeds"" utterly failed for me.  As a Christian, I'm very interested to see contemporary stories which illustrate eternal biblical truths so convincingly.  Breaking Bad shows us with stunning yet compassionate clarity just exactly how ""the wages of sin is death"".  As a younger person, I heard that and took it to mean that God was a mean-spirited, hanging judge.  Naturally, I turned away from the God of the Bible if that is what he offered.  Boy, did I get it wrong!  Death and destruction are the natural fallout which occurs when we step outside of God's plan for us.  If we put our faith in Him and live according to His will, this chain reaction of corruption doesn't get rolling, but if we put our faith in ourselves above all, we cut ourselves off from His peace.  Walter White is not a bad guy by the world's standards.  He wants to provide for his family, etc. but he steps outside of the boundaries and all Hell breaks loose.  Unintended, tragic consequences.  Jesse is a wonderful character as well.Breaking Bad manages to show us real characters with whom we can identify and sympathize in spite of their horrendous choices.  We're never expected to regard their bad behavior as ""cute"" the way we are meant to do in ""Weeds"".I think this series is one of the more moral and intelligent shows I've seen in a long time.  I like it for the same reasons I loved The Wire.
",5
"
  I have never found a show more enthralling than Breaking Bad. I always thought the Sopranos was one of the best written shows ever, I think Breaking Bad is right up there. The pace of Breaking bad is different from the Sopranos, but the writing, acting, AMAZING. It's now my top.
",5
"
  It was very interesting!  Although I very much dislike the whole premise of making drugs to sell, there are so many other sub-plots that make it thought-provoking and morally challenging.
",4
"
  The show is awesome.  there are no words to explain how excellent the series is. It so the plague of the underpaid teachers and the government republican cuts to education.  That make teachers work 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet. God forbid you get sick on a teachers salary.  It is deffenatally worth watch, even if it is about meth.  Give it a chance, and enjoy.
",5
"
  I'm so sad it's over. I could watch 10 more seasons of this show. A great display of excellent TV without the use of excessive gore, nudity or cursing. Sure there was a little of each but it added to the show, never took away or was too distracting.
",5
"
  Sorry I am not able to buy the rest of the series. If it were free I would watch more. It's too expensive for me.
",4
"
  This is an intense drama that explores human nature under extreme duress and makes bones about it!!  You might not want to stop watching the whole series just to see what happens.  Forget the reality shows and get a load of this!  Not for the faint of heart!  Worth the money - I just wish there was more - and there is with the second season.
",5
"
  I was so enraptured that I watched the first season over 2 days!It is like 'Weeds' with a little more umpf. I like it for some of the same reasons that I liked 'Falling Down';  You can relate to why Mr White snaps, and what he is going through.  It is dark,  but with a nice amount of teacher humor, science humor and life humor.  Mr White has a conscience, but less tolerance for the injustices of the world & less regard for the law, now that he sees that his days are numbered.  He has the motivation to do whatever he needs to to leave his family with financial security and the kind of courage you get when you have almost nothing left to lose.  Mr White is my kind of Hero!

  Breaking bad is a best series.

  Love Breaking Bad! We'd never watched the show, but wanted to jump in from Season 1, so we bought the Blu-ray. The only disappointment was that it was only 8 episodes (a quick google search reminded us that this was filmed during the writer's strike... remember that?!). I see that the other seasons are a more normal 13-episdoes.

  I chose 5 stars because this movie is very well written & the actors are very good in it-all of them! From Walter White all theway to the guys on the street, everyone does a GREAT job!!  Looking forward to season 2!

  Incredibly well written and acted.  The topic is nothing I would ever be interested in, but, once I saw the first show, I was hooked.  You have to watch every little detail, because, later it will probably relate to something.  I'm so sorry the series is over.

  A friend who is a fan of Br. Ba. recommended I start watching but I should start at the beginning. I purchased Season One and have watched several episodes and love this show.  I can see why she was hooked on it. Different from other TV drama but quirky, with some excellent acting.

  I wanted to own the DVD of my favorite show ever, and this works perfectly. The quality is exceptional and doesn't disappoint. I will be buying season 2 soon!

  Addicted to this series. No problems with any of the DVDs. Brillant acting and directing. Good luck trying to watch just one episode at a time :) Husband and I have all of them (purchased season by season) and have stayed up way too late watching this, but you just can't stop.

  It may not be for everyone but I loved the entire series. How much more creative can a series be and the acting if phenomenal.  And then there is Albuquerque - what an fantastic setting for this series.  Everything works perfectly. Love it!

  Can you imagine doing the pitch for this program? ""OK there is this high school teacher thak needs money because he is dying so he starts making Meth"" I did not see this when broadcast but my wife and I are hooked and already half through season three- WARNING- This not for kids series might be addictive, you could be hooked after only one episode.
",5

  If a better television drama has ever been produced, then I don't know what it is. The story of a high school chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin is simply unmatched. Gripping television at its finest.

  Started watching this series recently to see if I could catch up to the ending this year.  Expected it to be intense and good, but am pleasantly surprised by the humor.  Excellent writing, and fantastic performances by all actors, especially Bryan Cranston.  I suspect there will be less to laugh about as mild Walter gets more involved and adept at his criminal life, but this series already has me hooked and I'll see it through to the end regardless.

  We don't have cable but have heard so much about this series that I blindly bought the whole set.  Started watching with a bit of hesitation but got so caught up that it is hard to turn it off.  Glad I don't have to wait week to week to see what is up next.

  Someone recommended this to me and I thought I'd give it a try..After the first disc I wasn't sure if it was for me but I kept going .I have now completed seasons 1,2,3,4 and anxious for season 5.It was superific!! Loved it, Loved it!
",5
"
  If you have not seen breaking bad you should. It is about the hand we get dealt in life and the choices we make to make things better for you and your family. There is the hard path and the easy path in life and deciding between right and wrong. ""Is it ok to do something bad if the end goal is to do something good?""Season 1 sets up the back story for the rest of the series and is worth watching but is not as exciting as say season 3,4,and 5.
",4
"
  I watched the entire series in a little over a week. At first I hated it but by the 3rd episode I was hooked. I am sorry it's over. All the characters are so believable, the story never gets boring. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something worth watching.

  A gift for my husband.  He loves this.

  Very enjoyable; the writers definitely keep you guessing as the story line is not what I would call typical. We just got into this as the season finale is close to airing, so we are enjoying it without commercials. Warning if you have not seen this before; it is very addicting.

"
  Reels you in from the first minute. I have watched the last four seasons in about a month. If I have a free ten minutes, I'm trying to cram as much in as I can. The characters are rich and as real as life, and the decisions and mistakes they make are based on a sense that the viewer can completely understand. Only watch if you are ready to view all five seasons, because you will get hooked.

  God I loved this series, more than any other series! I was in Afghanistan at the time and filled my down time with watching pleasure. It arrived in good shape.

  I purchased the DVD's to have them available for whenever they are no longer available on Amazon or Netflix but haven't worked my way thru all of the DVD's though I have watched all of the seasons and loved it. I was a bit disappointed that there were no subtitles in English for the DVD version  - I like to have those up so I don't miss any of the great dialogue.  Otherwise, this is one of my FAVORITE shows of all time.  Great writing, fantastic characters, interesting pace and entertaining dark comedy mixed in with the serious 'evil' of drug lords.  I would recommend to adults; not for young viewers (but I'm old fashioned that way) and if you ever make it past the first episode you'll be hooked forever.
",5

  The action is intense and you can see this mild manner teacher take on a new role due to changes in his life. The violence is sometimes graphic and there are many seedy characters. I liked it so much - I bought the next two seasons for some binge watching.

  I love the Breaking Bad series because the acting is superb and the writing is outstanding.  The characters are each consistent in their vulnerabilities.  The concept of a mild chemistry teacher slowly changing to meet new challenges is very exciting.

  Oh yeah...I remember. This is series one in which I become absolutely addicted to this show. I watched the WHOLE season in one day then immediately rented the next season (2). The first season introduces you to the key figures involved, which are all somewhat eccentric...or at the edge of that category.The twists and immersion of the actors is tremendously thought out as well as the casting.Believe me, you won't walk away without wanting more.

  Bryan Cranston is absolutely amazing as Walter White, a loving family man stricken with terminal cancer. In a desperate attempt to provide financial security for his family, the chemistry teacher joins forces with a former student Jesse to make the best quality meth lab around.This is a very stylized story driven by the number of odd and quirky characters that surround Walter. His pregnant wife Skyler knows Walter has a secret but what could it be? Add in Walter's streetwise brother-in-law who is a DEA agent, and there is quite a story here.Jesse, the low level drug dealer, and conservative and proper Walter become allies and unwilling friends in a world of violence and murder. Somehow a story about two drug dealers becomes a fascinating study of human nature and a fight between good and bad. Meth dealers as heroes of a show? Somehow it works mainly because we only see the ""bad"" guys in this scenario - not the addicted buyers of the meth.Be ready for a high level of violence. Somehow Walter and Jesse stay ahead of the law and fellow drug dealers. A simple idea to make money becomes a life-threatening career that probably can only end in disaster and destruction.The writing is incredible as we follow the twists and turns of Walter's life. The obvious is never what it seems and somehow we believe it all and crave for more.Cranston is at his absolute best as the cancer-striken chemistry teacher in for the fight of his life on many levels. Cranston's appearance and demeanor changes as he progresses through chemo and his new life as a criminal.It's all absolutely amazing.

  From episode 1 to episode 7 you are in for a ride. The best pilot you've ever seen it's in this Blu-ray. This is worth more than what Amazon.com  is charging and I sure would pay more for it if I had no choice. Luckily I have a choice and so do you. BUY IT!

  I didn't start watching BB until Season 3  so thought I'd do some back fill binging to ""catch up"".  Glad I  did. Season 1 is as good as 3, 4 and 5 (to date). No commercials is nice as well. Wish it had been about $5 less but at $12 for 7 episodes it worked out to be about $1.75 per hour for first class entertainment. Not a bad deal.

  Pretty good series as far the plot goes. Don't really care for shows that have violence as a means to an end though. Walt plays a really good role as a chemistry teacher and as a meth cook to help defray costs associated with his radiation and chemo treatments which his insurance won't pay.

  In Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston stars as a 50 year old chemistry teacher, who discovers he is in the late stages of lung cancer. He has a wife who is pregnant with their second child, and their first child is a teenager with a physical disability. He learns about all the money made by meth dealers, he figures he can make some quick money before he dies by manufacturing crystal meth. You won't believe the challenges he faces trying to succeed in a world of bad people, when he is such a good person to begin with.Strongly recommend this series. I was sad to see that it didn't have english subtitles.I don't know why we had to wait a year for this first season to come out on DVD, and I'm glad the new season has started. I hope I don't have to wait a year for the second season to come out on dvd too, because now I don't have cable, so I have to wait for it to come out on dvd. If you've seen the first season you'll understand the pain i feel in having to wait (hopefully not) two years for the second season to come out on dvd. I can't wait to see what happens next!

  So fun and like some of the characters, so addicting! Just as the characters can't live without their drug of choice, neither can one live without Breaking Bad.

  If you have not watched this series, I have to recommend it. I'm addicted (bad word choice - you'd know what I meant if you were a viewer). Awesome videography, great acting, it's got everything a good series should.

  great
",5
"
  What is there to say other than breaking bad is one of the best shows to air in tv history. I bought this for a Christmas party. The product came fast and was as pictured...you can't go wrong here...great dhow
",5
"
  Bought for my FIL for holidays and now they are ""addicted"".Oddly, when we (me and DH) were watching the series on TV, we would ask co-workers and friends if they watched it and they had no clue what we were talking about. Have got many friends to love this series. Although I wonder about that still don't have a clue about the series. Do they live under a rock?

  I had a pinched nerve in my neck and was off work for 2 weeks. This dynamite series grabbed me and kept my mind off pain. I watched nonstop aome days and found the series to have an enticing storyline and great acting. Loved it!
",5
"
  The premise of the show sounds really hincky, I know, but the show is truly awesome.  It is the best show on television (sorry, Mad Men).  It is so well written, has so many layers, the acting is outstanding, and it shows that there are consequences to your actions.  For me, it's equal to the quality of ""The Wire.""
",5
"
  Hooked on Breaking Bad.
",5
"
  If you haven't seen this groundbreaking series yet... Come out of the cave you are living and enter into the light!
",5
"
  arrived quickly. no problems
",5
"
  My mother and sister talked me into this.  Glad they did.  We've only watched the first six episodes and are hooked.  It's funny and dramatic at the same time.  I have season 2 in my shopping cart.
",5
"
  Of course Season One was great. Every season of Breaking Bad was great!  I am a die hard fan of the show and will miss future episodes on the telly.  All good things must come to an end, especially if Heisenberg has run out of time.
",5
"
  Best series I've seen since The Wire.People will go to strange lengths to take care of their family.  The wire educated me on drugs and street life and Breaking Bad gave me a glimpse into the world of Meth - and by the way, what is a ""teenth""?
",5
"
  As good a series as The Sopranos. Multiple storylines are interwoven and fall back on each other in surprising ways. Watch this series!!!!
",5
"
  Kind of a tedious repetitive morality lecture with really good actingInteresting enough and novel enough in the world of TV serials to keep me going through the last episode, but just barely.Annoying that season five is broken into two separately sold sets, thereby doubling the $, but even more annoying that wasn't made clear. I mean if you're gonna charge me double for the final season, then fine, but don't hoodwink me!
",4
"
  Great series. The plight of Walter White draws the viewer to his side
",5
"
  we were not on the breaking band wagon so i thought we'd try season one to see if we wanted to net flix the series.so far so good.  we will watch the rest of this season and go on to the next.  quick shipping
",5
"
  Satisfied all around!
",5
"
  I loved this TV show. Unfortunately, I loaned my Season 1 DVDs to someone and never got them back. That person has since left the company that we both work for.
",5
"
  Item was exactly as shown and shipped promptly, will use again. THANX!!!
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is one of the best written and acted series I've ever seen. The characters are sensational, yet flawed like all humans. Although larger than life, it is still believable and incredibly entertaining. The viewer is amazed show after show.
",4
"
  All the episodes so far in the first three seasons are filmed beautifully and there are so many disturbing plots that you cannot help but want to move on as fast as possible, but don't ... save a little for the weekend.
",5
"
  Wow what a cool show!!!
",5
"
  What can you say about this series? It is interesting exciting and thought provoking. Would you go as far as Walt to save and support your family. And how in the world did he choose Jesse as his partner. Great series, highty recommend.
",5
"
  You already know it's great. Nuff
",5
"
  We started watching season one on DVD after it had been on a few seasons.  My husband and I sat over a weekend and watched every episode.  Once we started, we could not stop.  There is 3 shows until the series finale right now, and we are so sad!  I've never been this addicted to a television show in my life.  The writing, acting, and plot are absolutely brilliant.  I am re-watching every episode!  And yes, I do have a life!  Start with season one, and don't miss an episode!
",5
"
  The series just concluded and I have listened to everyone talk about what a great show this is.  I decided to get the first season knowing only the basics of the plot.  I have been so pleasantly surprised.  It has exceeded all of the hype that I have heard.  Great writing, wonderful acting.
",5
"
  this series is fantastic Bryan Cranston freaking rules this series. Its wild entertaining i must watch for any tv series watcher out there this series delivers the goods never letting down.
",5
"
  A few friends told me that I'd like this show. After the first episode I thought ""this is not for me."" The told me to commit to three episodes. I did, and was hooked.  Very well written series with great character development.
",5
"
  Really weird series representative of the drug culture today, while still being reminiscent of every other TV show you have ever seen: corny.
",5
"
  First of all this a must buy if you love sopranos, weeds, the wire etc. Perfect cast and just great acting with a storyline that is top notch. This show is one of the best shows ever, and is filled with nonstop surprises. It follows Walt who is a chemistry teacher diagnosed with lung cancer. Walt runs into a former student of his Jesse, and starts down the drug kingpin path cooking meth. He needs money to secure his wife and sons financial stability as he has only two years approx. to live. Dont wanna give anything at all away so thats it buy it, trust me you will love it.
",5
"
  I love the show so much that I just HAD to buy the entire DVD set of all the years so that I can watch it, marathon style, now that I am severely mourning the end of the series. This show is superb, and the writing, acting, and characters are addictive!!
",5
"
  This series really pulled us in and we could not stop watching it. Walt and Jessie were both so powerful to watch together. I have bought the whole series and am sharing with my family, not grand kids though! Very adult!
",5
"
  I was happy to find this at a decent price to give to my dad to check out
",5
"
  Sure helped on a long plane ride
",5
"
  Loved it
",5
"
  Now I see what all the hype was about. This show has great acting and an entertaining story line. The writing is awesome for a cable show.
",5
"
  Husband writes: It's just not fair, I don't watch many TV 'shows,' and recently watched the pilot episode after hearing all the buzz about the series finale.  Well crud, got hooked and am buying it up season by season.  Expensive, but this is now my meth addiction.  Buyer beware - stay away or suffer the same.
",5
"
  I and my wife like it.
",5
"
  This is another gift I purchased for a friend who loves watching this and I personally cannot explain about this type of Movie.He enjoys it and was a special Christmas gift. Came early and was very pleased with the outcome. Thanks.
",5
"
  My brother in law missed the series so I got this for him for a Christmas gift in 2013. He watched every episode twice, he loves it. For the DVD to contain an entire seasons worth of shows it's really affordable.
",5
"
  too bad my computer won't open the instant video... haven't a clue why; I've done everything ....  a waste of $10.00I ended up watching the series at a friends home on Netflix.
",5
"
  Great series for adults
",5
"
  where was I during the past 5 years when this show was airing? I have only gotten into 2 episodes of season 2 and need to watch fast because the final season is about to begin!
",5
"
  I had been resisting Breaking Bad for years because of all the media hype around it, but Season One was amazing.  I would put it up there for me with Battlestar Galactica Season One for watchability.  Riveting.
",5
"
  When I first read about the premiere episode of ""Breaking Bad"" in the media, my wife and I made sure we saw the beginning. We were hooked from the first segment. It has the kind of drama and tension that makes you regret the end of each week's showing. It has consistently improved each season. Walt and Jesse are complicated and the best of partners and adversaries to each other.What a great show! When I have exposed other people to the show, they all thank me for the recommendation. Cannot be patient for the next one to begin.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is probably the best series on television. It is well cast, well written, and well done. Nothing can touch it. I just finished the whole series and am ready to start it all over again! Don't miss it! It will have you hooked immediately!
",5
"
  I now understand why this series was so popular.  Though a dark subject, the acting is superb and I'm actually learning a lot!
",5
"
  As I stated in the title the show starts extremely slow but gets very good in the last few episodes of the season. The Blu-Ray quality is poor at best and doesn't look near as crisp as other Blu-Rays that I own.
",4
"
  Great Show, about to watch 3rd time.
",5
"
  We watched the entire series.  The first season draws you in because of the excellent writing and the actors are superb.  Not for those who avoid violence.  It caused us discussion on how far a person would step outside the law for his family.
",5
"
  It's good, I'm enjoying the story, it's turning to be a dark story of the downward spiral of a couple of men.  I like seeing the story filmed in Albuquerque and having NM references, reminds me of home.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad has a very unique story line.  Very unusual.  Bryan Cranston is great at portraying Walter White.  I understand that the series could not go on for much longer, but I will miss it.
",4
"
  I do try not to get sucked into television shows, my son showed me the first episode and my resolve crumbled to bits.  Highly adictive.
",5
"
  yep, I got hooked. Love the show. Binge watched it.. so glad I waited until I could binge, so I didn't have to wait each week to watch it. This show rocks!
",5
"
  Enjoyed it
",5
"
  excellent show. I didn't think I would like a show about cooking meth, so I didn't watch it on TV. A friend said it was one of the best shows ever so I tried it, and now I am hooked!
",5
"
  This show is awesome.  i got rid of cable last year (one of the best ideas i've had) but i miss shows like this.  i had no idea breaking bad was this good.  a must watch if you're like me and don't have time to watch much.
",5
"
  best series ever and I;ve been watchin many decades.  best performance ever by Brian Cranston.
",5
"
  It is one of the best serial dramas ever brought to television.  I bought this for a relative who had never seen it, and of course he was immediately hooked and had to binge-watch the rest.
",5
"
  This is one of the best tv series.  This show isnt a pro-drug propaganda piece, it shows the downsides to narcotics and what can happen when even the most honest people become desparate.  Very funny and entertaining.  I can't wait for the third season!!
",5
"
  The first season is the best for chemistry lovers.Bought this as a gift for my mother, who was also a teacher. She said it was a sad story, but she watched it all!
",5
"
  Wow. People just keep talking about Breaking, so it was time, finally, to watch it. Just like the addicting meth Walter cooks and Jesse sells, the show grips and pulls viewers in. Now, nothing will do but to watch them all!
",5
"
  Great production
",5
"
  The best of the best entertainment.  Highly recommended.  I should have paid more attention in my high school chemistry class!!!
",5
"
  none
",5
"
  seemed like a good season.  heard a lot of things about it.  but couldnt get past the second episode.  was a little slow.  might give it another chance later on.
",4
"
  very nice, thank you
",5
"
  I just love this series. Incredibly well written episodes with plenty of surprises. Combine that with incredible casting.I marathon watched this series because I couldn't stop watching.
",5
"
  Our kids watched this on netflix.  They all agreed on how much they like it.  We bought the first three seasons to watch on our computer.  Need to get the next few seasons.
",5
"
  My introduction to the greatest TV drama of all time, and the beginning of Walt's downfall. ""Crazy Handful of Nothin"" is the episode that hooked me, with one of the coolest  Heisenberg moments ever!
",5
"
  I have not seen Breaking Bad before and I think it is great. I feel for Walter and hate to see that getting sick made him stand up for himself. Can't wait to finish watching the rest of the seasons.
",5
"
  What a great series!  Perfectly cast!  Brilliantly written and directed!  If you're not squeamish, this is the series for you!
",5
"
  Since I cannot afford to buy all the episodes at once I am starting to buy one at a time as the prices go down.This series is amazing with great action and comedy.  The characters are larger than life.
",5
"
  Content is great!! I love this show.  Only reason for 4 stars is you might as well just but the DVD for the same price.  Then, you have the bonus content, which isn't included in the ""prime"" version.
",4
"
  This show isn't as good as the hype but it was okay.  It's hard to remain interested in the show and comic portion is somewhat crude at best.
",3
"
  This arrived in a timely fashion and worked as advertised.
",5
"
  I was hooked the moment this started and I met the lead characters, Mr. White is great, Jesse is adorable, Hank is hilarious the kids and a wifes are a perfect fit.
",5
"
  Only watched the free overview  for ordering paid episodes.Enjoyed the shows I viewed on cable tv.
",4
"
  I didn't know anything about this show, so we downloaded season, even though it cost $12 for 7 episodes. We're hooked!!  We're prepared to download season 2, even though there is a $21 charge.  But season 2 has 13 episodes.  If the season 2 episodes are as good as season 1, we'll be buying season 3--definitely recommend!
",5
"
  Great so far. Wish we didn't have to pay for the first season. The rest of the seasons are free on Prime. Just go to Library and check out season 1 and there you go.
",5
"
  All the hype is true.  Mind blowing ""what if"" of normal suburban life of a social geek suddenly in the drug world.  Loving, real, relationships crashed onto extraordinary circumstances with a flavor of ""camp"" as you go ""WTF"".
",5
"
  Bryan Cranston is a master actor! His range is unparalleled - from quiet do-gooder to a man with a mission (who begins to realize the power and strength he never knew he possessed), Cranston rules in this amazing series!
",5
"
  This is single most thought provoking series I've seen since Lost. The character chemistry is explosive! I could have done without the decomposed human clean up. I am mesmerized and will keep watching.
",5
"
  My husband and I decided to see what all the awards were about.  We watched Season 1 and I'm afraid we're hooked.  We HAVE had the discussion about the fact that we are hooked on a show about a guy with terminal cancer and drug pushers.
",4
"
  it is amazing how quickly this show pulls you in.  First two episodes will usually do it.
",4
"
  Bought the first season on Amazon Prime. I watched the pilot tonight and it was NOT censored as far as I can tell. There were four letter words and nudity. So maybe Amazon has changed its tune.
",5
"
  I only was able to watch the pilot for free.  I think I""m a little hooked on it, so I may go back and buy the entire season.
",5
"
  Incredible series!! So many twist and turns I don't expect ! Keeps us on the edge of our seats! Finally ! A show we can watch without being bombarded by those ridiculous virtual reality shows!! That's a BIG THANK YOU!!
",5
"
  Greatest show of ALL time. A work of art. As great as anything created by a human being.
",5
"
  Great premise, writing, acting.  Every time you think it can't get any edgier, it does - and in ways you don't expect.  I just finished Season 1 and immediately ordered Season 2.  I'm hooked!
",5
"
  seems like a really good series,..i am just beginning the first of the first season, ..but, the lack of subtitles, in English, .... really makes watching this, for me, somewhat difficultthe characters are often not that easy to understandfast-paced, great scenery, great acting, very believable, lost in their 'reality',good buy, gave it a four, 'cause of the lack of english subtitles,..spanish, french & portuguese, -- how difficult would it have been to add the english?,.. and in this day and age, .. almost ALL dvds have english subtitles!
",4
"
  I was one of the few people in the world who never watched the show, but once it had its finale I realized I must have missed something. I love it and will have to get the rest of the seasons.
",5
"
  I watched the entire series over about 3 weeks.  I was totally addicted.  However, would never recommend for juveniles.  A lot of violence & constant vulgar language.  Each episode ended with a hook!
",5
"
  It's Breaking Bad. What else do I have to say? If you don't like it, you are developmentally disabled, really old, or a wuss.
",5
"
  OMGosh, who doesn't LOVE Breaking Bad? If you haven't seen this show, don't hesitate to buy the first season, you will not be disappointed.
",5
"
  I had not seen this series but so many of my friends were raving about it so I decided to buy the first season to see what everyone was talking about.  I am totally hooked and have already purchased the remaining seasons.  Love it!
",5
"
  We love this show
",5
"
  If you have hooked into Breaking Bad in a future season, you MUST watch the first season in order to appreciate the transformation of the characters. Special features related to the ""making of"" are also very interesting.
",5
"
  Love it....I can see why it was such a hit! Cranston is awesome!
",5
"
  This Blu-Ray came in excellent condition. Way better than I expected. I am so happy and so impressed. I am telling everyone how happy I am, and I am telling some people twice!!! I was told this would be in on a certain date and it actually came in 2 days earlier! I was so impressed!
",5
"
  Everybody already knowsit's good
",5
"
  Awesome. Enough said.
",5
"
  A must watch show. I really like the first season. The pilot episode is strong! The other seasons are great as well!
",5
"
  Excellent plot, good acting, brilliant idea this series is a hit an honorable man doing everything by the book while his life is suddenly tiene upside down by ""another "" bad news
",5
"
  This show is a roller coaster of emotion and chaos. It is well written and well cast and takes the viewer through quite an ordeal with their experience. It was not quite as funny as I had hoped but it did have some situational humor that kept it from being too heavy. It has quite a few gruesome scenes and is definitely not for the weak of stomach.
",5
"
  This is the uncensored version.Had never watched Breaking Bad before so bought this Pilot to see what all the buzz is about.
",5
"
  It was cheaper to buy the DVD than to rent it from Amazon to watch, so I bought it.
",5
"
  show is very well written.  the scenes are unpredictable and the acting so good you almost develope a personal connection to some of the characters.  an addictive show!
",5
"
  the pilot differs from the rest of the series.  it's mostly plot development for the rest of the series.  awesome, but mostly introductory.  if you have to buy a season, start with 3 or 4.
",5
"
  This set was a gift and was received with delight. My family and I have watched every episode of every season. It's one of the best series ever created and makes a great gift for a fan of this show.
",5
"
  I was very excited to find this online at such a great price. Within the first few episodes I was hooked. This show was amazing and defintely worth the buy. Shipped quickly and in great condition.
",5
"
  People from work have been telling me for the longest time to watch this.  I am sorry I waited.  Just got done watching the first season and it was great so I ordered the entire series.
",5
"
  I love this show. I was sort of skeptical at first and hoped that drugs weren't glorified.  Not at all. The grit and ugliness of the drug world is shown. I love the characters, the writers and the story line.  I think the show is perfectly casted and I have been a fan of Bryan Cranston since he was Tim Watley on Seinfeld. If you haven't tried the show yet, don't waste more time, just order the series and let the fun begin!!
",5
"
  Awesome DVD set, great story and loving Walter White.
",5
"
  Ordered this for my daughter and son-in-law as a Christmas present.  They don't have AMC on their TV, so they were thrilled to get this as well as all the other Seasons!  This came careful wrapped and sealed.  This is a Good Seller!
",5
"
  Slowly starting out in season 1 , but turned out really good.
",5
"
  A binge series....you will get hooked like an addict.
",5
"
  Great show.
",5
"
  Hilarious, but a lot of gore and violence. The kid who plays the druggie is too good for words! Even so, I won't buy the next season. Parts of it are truly painful to watch---the cancer parts. To each his own.
",4
"
  Perfect condition.
",5
"
  how fast can i say this is one of the most important televisual feasts of all time? The MASH of a new time. Real. Edgy.This is not Tim Watley with a schictkel of flouride-no anti-dentites. Hang on
",5
"
  I had heard so many good things about this show and had to join the bandwagon.  I'm so glad I did, one of thebest series I've seen, next to Dexter.  I just completed the second season and ordered the third.  You won't be disappointed!
",5
"
  Season 1 of Breaking Bad sets the stage for what is the best series I have ever watched. Season 1 draws you toward a giant of desperation, committment, family, heartbreak, love and the tenderness of a baby.  Not enough words to describe how great it is.
",5
"
  My husband and I are about to watch the last two episodes of season 1 so I can't rate in its entirety just yet but we have enjoyed this show. The acting is great by almost every character. I would say that it is very dark and you might say depressing to watch. But we'll be ordering season 2 once we're done and I would say we're hooked!
",4
"
  Best TV show ever! Stop reading this and start watching! Seriously why are you still reading this?
",5
"
  Surprising what could happen when some people gets pushed to the limit with what life dishes out.  You don't want to believe it by thinking it only happens in movies but something will tug at the back of your mind.
",5
"
  It is a creative work of genius! I love the character Jesse Pinkman! The small cast of characters really develop a large network of what lengths one really needs to stretch to survive.
",5
"
  Binge watch this series
",5
"
  Great morality play.  Some really unlikable characters.  Superb plot development.  (And I'm really loving ""Better Call Saul"")
",5
"
  I never thought I'd be happy for a meth-cooker, but this suspenseful and funny series is great, you can't help but be on the ""Bad Guys"" side at times.  Brian Cranston is great, as is Aaron Paul!!
",5
"
  Outstanding series and exceptional acting.  Bryan Cranston is especially good.  But all the other actors are equally as good.  I liked Dean Norris (Hank) also. He was as good as Walt.
",5
"
  I'm a huge fan of this series. It is tense, funny, outlandish, dramatic, and scary. Tremendous acting and strong characters. If you are a fan of Pulp Fiction and other crime genres with a twist, I think you'll like this.
",5
"
  One of the best series I have ever watched in my life.  If you like cliffhangers, character development, and high drama -- You will love ""Breaking Bad"".  The Blue Ray looked great on our HDTV.
",5
"
  It arrived when it said it would.  I thought I ordered it on blu-ray, but it was DVD.  I guess that was my fault :(  still an amazing  series!
",5
"
  Wonderful.  Very entertaining.  Sterling performances by all the people in the series.  If you don't get involved, you need to check your pulse and respiration.
",5
"
  Ok already... kept hearing about this show. Got sick of hearing about it. Gave in and got it for my husband for Christmas.  We watched all four seasons in one week.  Love Love Love it.
",5
"
  Loyal (and I mean LOYAL) ""Breaking Bad"" fans know this series started with an interesting premise and with some of TV's most talented writers and awe-inspiring performances continues to only get better. If you've yet to dive into the completely justified hysteria that surrounds ""Breaking Bad,"" go ahead. Start with Season 1, episode 1. I'll wager dollars to doughnuts, you'll marathon your way through the seasons until you're like the rest of us: chomping at the bit, waiting for next summer's final eight episodes.
",4
"
  I had my reservations even with all the good reviews out there on Breaking Bad. Watched it this past weekend and was hooked. This is a very original show and script with ex co-star Malcolm in the Middle actor doing a great acting job.
",5
"
  Began watching this series after several friends recommended it to me.  I'm not big on TV, but this series has me hooked.  Great find!!  Highly recommended.
",5
"
  Bryan Cranston has been one of my most favorite actors since malcom in the middle. He knocks it out of the park with this series
",5
"
  I had only seen the name of the program while flipping through the TV guide. It wasn't until a friend of mine told me about the show did I start tuning into season 4. I was so intrigued by the story line that I had to watch from the very begining to fully understand everything that had transpired. The transformation of Mr. White from the meek bumbling teacher to the kick-ass cook is what got me hooked. Not since Fox's Prison Break series have I been so captured by a TV show. Good job AMC!
",5
"
  The only way to watch this series is right from the beginning. Cannot turn off the TV. Love this show.
",5
"
  The best! Great acting, fantastic suspense. It really gives you something to think about and talk about!
",5
"
  How many people have to tell you what a great show...I finally broke down and watched the first season on Amazon Prime  the best ever...
",5
"
  Do not allow your firetv to default to amazon.com for breaking bad. You get charged every episode. Watch on netflix where they are all free.
",5
"
  I was hooked after watching about 3 episodes of Breaking Bad.This TV show will keep you on the edge, but it's got some pretty graphic material. Not for the faint of heart!
",5
"
  Great love the series
",5
"
  One of my favorite TV series of all time.
",5
"
  A very twisted show that will keep you wanting more. Bryan Cranston is great in this!
",5
"
  The first season is good but a bit slow but it gets better as it goes on.  The subsequent season just get better and better.  Watch the first season and get through it and you won't regret it.
",3
"
  Best show ever....If you have not seen Breaking Bad, you are missing out on a great piece of art. I am sorry that I purchased the individual seasons, now I will be buying the box set.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is the best moral drama ever in modern film - ABSOLUTELY BUY THIS SERIES!Modern day Shakespeare - perfectly crafted and perfectly ended.
",5
"
  everyone told me i would like this series and i did. this story of a drug dealer is so good it will make you think of what is right or wrong.
",5
"
  Had to get this in parts but we loved the whole series and bought it all and watched it as often as we could until it was all over.  Highly recommend the whole series.
",5
"
  Best show since HBO ""The Wire""
",5
"
  If you're not completely hooked by the end of this season, just give up and don't buy any more.  However, most will be completely hooked after the first episode!
",5
"
  This  started off slow.  It may get better in future  episodes.I think the plot is  good.  I might try the same thing if I were in his shoes.
",3
"
  I mean, without a doubt one of the best shows in history.  Very violent, but we don't mind that.  Writing is superb.  Always jealous of those who haven't seen it because they get to start from the beginning.
",5
"
  Clever and creative show, and very well acted for the most part. Lots of wry observations regarding our ridiculous economy and resulting social system built to protect it.
",5
"
  thank you for the fast delivery the discs were in excellent condition love this series wonderful ending there are no words to describe it
",5
"
  Didnt understand what all the fuss was about Breaking Bad...then I bought them!!!  OMG season one was amazing...cant wait to watch the others!!!
",5
"
  One of the best shows on television, made even better by the inclusion of cast/crew commentary on every episode. You will not be disappointed.

  I’m several years late to the Breaking Bad party, and I just got on the train by watching Season One.  The acting is very good and you really get sucked into the story.  Despite being such a bad topic – person turning to drugs for money, the associated destroying of lives, etc. – you find yourself rooting for the new drug dealer.  The series is engaging and I am off to order Season Two.Rather than a DVD, I purchased the season via the Video on Demand and have watched it on both my TV and Kindle Fire.  I really like the portability vs. having to have a DVD player!

  Great show loved every minute.

  I really got hooked on this show and did marathon viewings....it was hard to stop and sad when it was all over!
",5
"
  It doesn't get any better than Breaking Bad.  One of my all time favorite series!!!

  This was a gift - hasn't been viewed yet - so I don't know of the condition but the packaging looked good, seal looked new with no scratches or other issues appearing on DVD etc. very happy with the transaction.

   From the moment the pilot begins, you are drawn into a struggle between empathy for a struggling husband, disdain for a drug violent culture and some seriously comedic moments involving both.  Bryan Cranston's character as Walter White goes through a complete transformation in this series and you can not help like this beat down nerd who turns unto one smart bad ass criminal.  The excellent cinematography and character development makes it hard to watch just one episode at a time,

"
  All of our under 40 friends kept saying you have to see this. We did not. Finally after the last season we ordered seasonOne.Bryan Cranston is exceptional  as Mr. White.
",5

  PERFECT.

  as described

  I loved the first season. Its a pretty good show, looking forward to buying season 2 for myself soon for Christmas. The finale was mind-blowing. I don't want to give away spoilers for anyone who wants to watch it. The characters are great by the way. Thank you Amazon for bringing this into my life, and I got a decent price for this. c:

  Excellent writing and surprisingly funny.  I have missed the good writing that Six Feet Under and Sex and the City had.  Thanks.
",5
"
  I don't watch much television, but I was riveted to this series.  Yes, some of the situations are extremely improbable, but that did not ruin it for me.  I haven't seen the second half of the final season yet and can't wait!
",5
"
  THIS SEASON IS EXPLOSIVE AND WILL KEEP YOU ON YOUR FEET. I LOVE THIS SERIES AND CANT WAIT FOR THE REST OF THEM TO COME OUT...
",5
"
  I missed it first time around.  It's extremely well done.  I've never been one for binge watching, but I've watched all 7 episodes in about 5 days.
",5
"
  The show is great, Did not like the fact that the episode I purchased was censored.If I'm paying for the episode I would like to see the show as it was originally broadcast.
",4
"
  My favorite show was here on Amazon as all my favorites.
",5
"
  Didn't see the series when it first aired. Heard so much about the writing and characters just had to see for ourselves.  It is great and the characters draw you in...can't wait to see what is going to happen next!!!
",5
"
  Sucks you into the reality of what if it was us? Would we be willing to enter a life of crime to secure for our families? I would like to think I'd have other options, but it makes for incredible TV!
",5
"
  One of the high points in modern television storytelling. This series rabks up there with THE WIRE as TV at its best.
",5
"
  Awesome show and shipped super fast.
",5
"
  Very Nice
",5
"
  Probably the best show I've ever watched, I just bought this DVD so I could share it with others.
",5
"
  Came in good shape and video was good quality. Did not have English closed captions.

"
  Great series
",5
"
  WOW. I waited a few seasons, was not really interested... then TONS of people said I HAD to watch it. i did. No regrets here.
",5
"
  Since we are Breaking Bad fanatics, I just had to send this poster to my sister. She loves it! May get one for myself....
",5
"
  We have introduced breaking bad to so many of our relatives and they all have become a show addict just like us. All seasons get 5 stars from me!
",5
"
  Very Happy with the purchase. I would highly recommend to anything who is thinking about getting this product. Looks and works great and very good quality.
",5
"
  Not exactly my cup of tea. However the show is written well, actors are all very fun to watch and it is a breath of fresh air from all the other cookie cutter shows out
",4
"
  It all started with season 1. What an awesome series.
",5
"
  I didn't pay attention to this show until the third season, by then I had no idea what was going on, so I didn't watch it. I'm starting from beginning, it a very powerful show.
",5
"
  Once you start watching this series you will want to order or borrow the rest of them because it's so addictive.  I was on line ordering the remaining seasons after watching episode 4 of the first season.
",5
"
  What can you say?  This series was fantastic.  Well written, great cast, well produced.  It had it all.  I was sorry to see it end.
",5
"
  I'd heard a lot about this show but until I saw the first season, I didn't realize how great it would be. Totally involved me, kept my interest and make me wanting more.
",5
"
  Great series have seen them all twice
",5
"
  Glad we were able to watch this binge style, all 4 seasons in a month. It lived up to the reviews
",5
"
  love it
",5
"
  This show is so creative and intelligent for TV.  I wish there were more shows like it.  It is right up there with ""House of Cards"" and ""Weeds""
",5
"
  Missed the first episode, thanks Amazon.  Worked great!!!
",5
"
  great movie i like the story around it and that charater plays their parts wonderfully. good pick in my collection
",5
"
  My husband loves this series and watched it a couple of times.
",5
"
  Just starting watching this. It has lots fo good reveiews from fellow employess. I'm enjoying it - eager to watch the other four seasons.
",5
"
  Glad I finally started watching, hard to stop, wonderful dark comedy.
",5
"
  Fantastic show. I couldn't stop watching it. I was sometimes up at 3am watching it. Yikes!
",5
"
  I love ""Breaking Bad"" it is terrific! Great cast & crew, great writing, directing! Amazing... I also love the dilemma Walter has himself in, it really forces you into a ""what would I do"" mindset. AMAZING A+
",5
"
  great show.  has the perfect mix of funny and action.. definatly not safe for kids to watch though. i would recomend this to anyone who likes action/drama/comedy
",5
"
  Kept me on the edge of my seat!  I love this show!
",5
"
  My husband loved this weird, violent and funny first season. Love Brian Cranston......can't wait to watch the next season and the next, then the next...etc
",5
"
  The series is ending this year and I needed to catch up on previous episodes.  Many of my family members are not aware of this series.  Its fun to watch the episodes with  them
",5
"
  love the series, had to replace this season.
",5
"
  You will not be able to stop with this season.  I had to buy the rest after this one. This is probably the best television series I have ever seen (and I've been watching tv for many decades!).
",5
"
  So much talk about this show that I finally wanted to check it out to see if it was just hype. It lived up to the hype, I loved it. The first couple of episodes were pretty intense but it mellowed out a little bit from there. Can't wait to see season two.
",5
"
  I bought this solely to support the series.  Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season (2008) was the best TV to come along in years.  It is much, much better when you can watch multiple episodes at a sitting.
",5
"
  I am late to the BB party. After hearing friends rave about it I finally started season one. OMG! It is fabulous! I will be binge watching this series for sure.
",5
"
  Don't start this series anywhere but at the very beginning.  The first episode will blow you away, and the story snowballs from there.
",5
"
  Best show
",5
"
  Excellent writing and excellent acting. I wasn't sure what to expect but this show totally sacked me in. It is a little violent but it's worth watching for sure.
",5
"
  I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1; am working through Season 2, and have just ordered Season 3!!!  I am totally addicted to this series.  This will be part of our Christmas programming !!
",5
"
  What's not to like?It's odd that I'd enjoy a series about a chem teacher selling meth. That aside, it's really well done. It's a compelling story, unpredictable, and the actors are incredible.
",5
"
  Great
",5
"
  Still great the second Time through it.
",5
"
  Best show I've ever seen on television.  Have the entire set and love them all.
",5
"
  The first episode will confuse and make you question just what is going on. It is a little slow at times but there is a lot of set up for the second season which is just unreal. It's a dark show but it is awesome.
",5
"
  After hearing everyone talking about this show for the last several years- finally gave in to watching it, wow! Amazing acting, great storyline- just starting season 2!
",5
"
  it's astonishing,sometimes funny,unforgetable, perfect casting,and makes a lasting impression.i had just about given up on tv shows until I stumbled upon this series. congrats.  wrrn2h

  Thank you

"
  Got the next season's from Netflix much cheaper
",5
"
  It took a few episodes to get into it, but then I was hooked!

"
  Excellent acting, story, concept.  Did not expect to like it but can't stop watching it now.  I'm a late bloomer.
",5
"
  Can't figure out why we never saw it when first premiered.
",5
"
  Best TV series ever! Good entertainment, good acting, good TV! Didn't think I would like the subject matter but it's just a very good show! Watch it!
",5
"
  Great catch up material!  I didn't watch the series when it was on television and really enjoyed the first season.
",5
"
  The show was great all the way to the last season but the earlier shows are the best. This is how it all started. I have enjoyed every season, this is the best show on television.
",5
"
  awesome
",5
"
  Great series.
",5
"
  Just incredible.... everything has been said.Gripping, crazy, real-life insanity.We are truely the product of our decision making.The hype is deserved.
",5
"
  At the urging of friends and family, we are in the midst of Season 1 and look forward to the weeks and months we have ahead catching up on this edgy and eloquent series.
",5
"
  Missed the shows when they started and began to catch up with the season videos.  Up to season 6 now and we agree, it is one of the best shows ever produced for TV.
",5
"
  The entire series was great!  I can't wait to start watching it again!We enjoyed it so much, we bought this for a Christmas gift for friends.
",5
"
  Very dark but with very clever writing and characterization.  I know we're late getting started on the series but I have a feeling we'll be blasting through them!
",5
"
  I picked these up on black Friday ($35 for all four seasons on blu ray).  Such a steal.  I sat down as soon as they came and watched them all.  It's a great show.
",5
"
  Great show.
",5
"
  all actors are top-notch, writing excellent--twists & turns all the time.  Think a writer or someone close to a writer has been diagnosed with cancer--all the scenes that discuss/show cancer are spot-on.  I was diagnosed w/ cancer April 2010.  Don't think I'd become Ms  Heisenberg but when you're dealing w/ cancer & want to help yr family after you're gone.....
",5
"
  can be interesting to consider it could happen we have been watching the show and look at it as entertaining
",5
"
  It's good.  However, I just came off the Sopranos...that's a hard one to beat...but very good.
",4
"
  Watch it, that's it. You will get hooked pretty quick. The series already ended, and I can say it is one of the best series ever created.
",5
"
  If you  don't  watch this  show (or  used to  watch it  when it was on)  you  really should. It is  awesome.  Great  DVD addition. No problems w/them at all.
",5
"
  Anyone who likes a rough and tumble show will enjoy BB.  Not for the person who doesn't like violence in their programming. the writers are amazing to be able to write such complex characters.
",5
"
  amazing series a must watch for any drama lover
",5
"
  making it the 2nd best show on television.  The first season contains more suspense on the nature of WW's actions, and he is a goof more often than later.
",5
"
  Exciting show.
",5
"
  Love the show, probably my favorite season as well.
",5
"
  Actually I didn't watch it Someone recommended it somI was just testing it but it was actually about the making of the series and I didnt have time to watch it
",4
"
  It is a several year drama series, so plan on buying all of them to complete or you will be looking for the answers later as it will leave you hanging.
",5
"
  Writing and acting just doesn't get any better than this!  It will be sorely missed...hopefully something else will come along equally as good.
",5
"
  It isn't clear whether this show is intended to be a comedy or a serious drama. It is funny at times, but what goes on in the story is so grim that it is hard to really laugh. If it is meant to be a serious show, it is too far off the wall to really be taken seriously.
",3
"
  This series had amazing acting, an exciting plot and thought provoking situations.  Highly addictiveand very entertaining.  I hate to see the series end.
",5
"
  I'm hooked
",5
"
  My wife and I bought seasons 1-5 and are completely satisfied with our purchase. Our monthly income has grown exponentially but our dentally costs our through the roof. We bought a trialer just like the show and we call it meals on wheels. We decided to go with a Halloween based name for or charity,""Crankenstein"". Highly recommend this series.
",5
"
  I was recently introduced to this show by a friend. Had seen it advertised before but had never watched it. Now I have a hard time stopping from watching and even rewatching it. Acting is great. Very mature subject matter and language.Really happy with this buy. Seller was great (and prompt).
",5
"
  ""Breaking Bad"" is my favorite series since  ""The Sopranos"" and ""House, M.D."" Fast-paced, but if you pay attention to details and follow the storyline, you can make sense of it pretty easily. The story of Walter White surely raises your awareness of just how prevailant and omnipresent meth is. You realize that the house or garage next door to you could be a meth lab. Please, whoever is reading this, DON'T DO METH!! It ISN'T WORTH IT!!!
",5
"
  Got this as a gift for someone, who asked several relatives for seasons 1-5.  I have watched all seasons, love the show.
",5
"
  This is where it all started.  What makes it so gripping is that the premise is so believable.  It makes you crave the next episode like a meth addict.
",5
"
  I was very late to the Breaking Bad party, but finally got there.  I had hear so much (positive) about this series, but never really gave it chance.  I'm so glad I did!I can't imagine anyone other than Bryan Cranston playing Walter White.  He does an amazing job of portraying a ""regular guy"" that turns to the drug world to provide for his family.I'm not overly impressed by the Walt's wife (the character), she seems too indecisive and when she finally does make a decision to speak up, she doesn't have much to say.  Maybe her character will develop as the series moves forward.Overall, an excellent series!
",5
"
  Can't get enough of the old great episodes of Breaking Bad.  Could watch it a hundred times.
",5
"
  This is some of the best writing and acting I've ever seen.  I bought the entire series and am now rewatching it with a friend.  It's just as good with the second viewing.
",5
"
  We watched the whole first season in a day and are on to the second. Brilliant performances, compelling action, great subtlety and humor.
",5
"
  Watch every episode, it is the best!  Just when you think that nothing else can happen, the story thickens!  I love this show and can't wait for the next season.
",5
"
  Love this season as much as all the others!  Highly recommend, but definitely watch the seasons in order so that you don't miss any of the interpersonal connections.
",5
"
  Husband loved this series.
",5
"
  A really riveting and interesting TV show that is much different than watch you normally see on TV. One of the best things I have ever seen on TV.
",5
"
  Very good suspenseful series
",5
"
  Thank you so much for getting this to me so quickly. I plan on watching the entire series after I have received them all. Waiting on Final Season release!
",5
"
  If life is boring you to the point of tears, give this show a try. Watch a self sufficient, good man confront death and explore the animal within during a time of mortal uncertainty.
",5
"
  You have to be able to see the hilarity in bad situations and this TV series is full of them.If the cover doesn't pique your curiosity as to what went on in the first season, I don't know what would.
",5
"
  Breaking hilarious!  This is one occasion where all the hype is true.  Endearing characters you want to love and hate at the same time.  Situational comedy with a twist.
",5
"
  Good

"
  Seriously, best drama ever on TV. You will be hooked: great acting, great writing, unpredictable. And I hate everything! Rarely like anything on TV. This is quality.
",5
"
  one of my favorite shows
",5
"
  I hear it gets rather raunchy as things progress but am nonetheless eager to watch further episodes, until I can't take it anymore, that is!
",5
"
  I watched the entire series on netflex. Greatest tv show ever!!!! Don't start watching until you can get all of the seasons.
",5
"
  IT is a worthwhile, plausible scenario, a real possibility. Loved it.A habit forming series that jus screams for ""I gotta have more""
",5
"
  I wanted a clean copy that was not scratched and leave me hanging in a cliff hanger scene. This was well worth the money.
",5
"
  My husband and I so enjoyed the first season, we are currently working on the third.  Definitely adult material...not for the faint of heart.
",5
"
  I love this show and could not wait for it to come out on DVD. The story line is certainly nothing that has ever been done before. Walt is endearing and the viewer can sympathize with what he is going through. His choices are perhaps not what the average person would choose, but they make for very interesting situations. The darker side of humanity, who hasn't thought of what they would do if they were diagnosed with a terminal illness? Definitely better viewed by mature audiences.
",5
"
  FOR ALL ITS NASTINESS, THIS MUST BE THE MOST RIVETING, COMPELLING, MARVELOUS TV SHOW EVER CREATED! i HAVE SEEN THE WHOLE THING TWICE!
",5
"
  This show gave me hope for the future of a good show. Kind of like when ""The Dark Knight"" came out.It's quite simply awesome. Great story and AMAZING casting. Bryan Cranston is my favorite actor.The only thing that dislike is how explicit the pilot is. A lot of uncomfortable parts in it that make me think, who would want to watch this, and ""Man, it must have been really awkward recording this scene.""But besides that, its my favorite show now. I suggest buying the rated version off of iTunes though.
",5
"
  This is probably one of the best series on TV ever.  Bryan Cranston is a fabulous actor.  I missed the first season, so I wanted to see it all.  This did not let me down.
",5
"
  After all the buzz about this series, I felt the need to check it out. I'm certainly conflicted about the premise of the show, rooting for a meth cooker and dealer- really?? Yet, I'm compelled to do just that.... The Walter Mitty characteristics of Walter sucked me right in. This is a well written and acted series.... Moving on to Season 2
",5
"
  fast

  My girlfriend failed to check netflix first so Im the proud owner of season one of a very darn good tv show. I'm currently on season 5!

"
  Best drama ever

"
  Like eating Potato chips, you can never get enough!

"
  From what I'd heard, I expected Breaking Bad to be a badass show having something to do with drugs and a chemistry teacher, but nobody made a point of saying that the first season has some of the funniest screen moments ever made. Breaking Bad is badass, but has something for most people still alive if you're open to the ideas that even good people do bad things, that most people are complex, and if you are not fixated on the idea of a cut and dry protagonist. The casting is brilliant. The physical comedy is brilliant. The premise is brilliant. It's freakin brilliant I tell you. My favorite characters are Hank and Walt Jr. but everybody truly is brilliant in their role.The show is about a H.S. Chemistry teacher who got screwed in his career as an innovative chemist and is spinning his wheels to try and secure the future of his family in dire times. Enjoy. I LOVE this series. It is perhaps my favorite ever. I laughed often and really, really hard during this first season.

  Love Breaking Bad. Needed this for my collection.

  I bought every series as a gift for my son-in-law.  I can't wait for him to experience the suspense of Breaking Bad!

  Breaking bad is kinda slow from season 1 all the way through.

  I loved the first season, can't wait to watch the second season, I find myself wondering what will happen next.

  This show sets the bar for dramas.  The first season is epic and really sets the tone for future episodes.

  I had not heard of Breaking Bad until last week when my neighbor told me about it. I watched some of the current shows on TV and am hooked. I wanted to get the whole story so bought Season 1 and am now plowing through Season 2. Compelling, very well written and acted.... I just love it!!!

  the pilot that started the whole walter white / jesse pinkman saga . i enjoy it every time i watch it

  This show grabs your attention and holds it from the opening minutes on! You can feel Walt's anxiety and emotions in every scene. Awesome show!

  Great way of taking you from total misery to cracking up and yet, understanding the thoughts and feelings of each character.Very interesting and fun to watch!

  The first few episodes were really good. I thought I was going to absolutely love this show. As we got closer to the end of the first season it started to get silly and not as realistic. I'd recommend watching it if it was on t.v. , but don't spend money on it.

"
  Best TV sires ever!!!  I was told i had to watch it so i bought the 1st season and its great.  i love that i can watch it anywhere i have internet access, I don't have friends at high school so at lunch i just get on and watch all alone Amazon's instant videos are the best!!!

  this is the greatest show ever, what can I say that most people don't know, only that there will never be another show like this again

  A very unique TV series if you are looking for something to watch and enjoy stuff like dexter and sons of anarchy you'll like this.

  Oh good grief, who doesn't love this show? It was clear it needed to end, but the world is bleaker for it.  What more is there to say?

  This show is excellent to watch yet unfortunately loading the episodes took a very long time. Each episide often stopped throughout with short or long pauses while our brand new TV WITH the Amazon app showed a full connection. Almost always, we would srart the show, cook dinner, eat then cleanup, only to return to the TV & the show not working.  Disappointed in Amazon since we had this happen months ago with a movie & they refunded our cost without us notifying them of issue. Bought Breaking Bad season 2 & no issues so far.

  The opening scene of the pilot is one of the greatest hooks I have ever seen, I was in for the duration after watching it.

  Pretty shocking beginning but gets better in the first episode and better still as they go on into the first season. It's as good as we've heard.

  Breaking Bad is an off-the-wall series about a high school chemistry professorwho comes down with lung cancer, and who resorts to drastic measures to provide for his eclectic family in case he dies.Now, don't be turned off by this subject:  This series is extremely well-written, with outstanding production by Vince Gilligan and Mark Johnson.The inimitable Bryan Cranston plays the lead role, accompanied by Aaron Paul as his often-aggravating side-kick.Breaking Bad is simply bizarre, and at the same time has an underlying sense of humor, despite the subject matter.It's so hard to explain what's good, better yet GREAT, about Breaking Bad.I guess it's that rare combination of great writing, unparalleled acting, combined with a totally unique subject matter, that takes this series over the top.AMC deserves accolades for presenting this truly original series.If you like mature drama, get BREAKING BAD.

  Amazon was running a great price when I bought mine. Is it a dark comedy? I hope so 'cause otherwise it's just Dark. Too bad our teachers are so abused and under paid. We could end up with other really smart people doing strange things to survive.

  WITH ALL THE TEASERS, IT'S STILL ALL OVER. LUTHER IS A GOOD FOLLOW UP AS IS HOMELAND; ALL GOOD ACTING

  This is not the show, it's just a 10 minute preview of the series with some behind the scenes stuff. That said, it's free, and for fans of the show, a delight to watch.

  Not only a fun (if dark) plot, but great camera work and character evolution. Lots of nuances to enjoy. Probably inspire a lot of students to become chemists.

  OMG this is one of the best shows out on DVD now. You feel for these characters. The ups and downs but they stick together.

"
  My husband started watching this show an loved it but because of his part time job could not always watch it every week so he is thrilled to have the set
",5
"
  Yes
",5
"
  I was told by friends a while ago to watch this series and alas I have finally succumbed.  I am addicted.
",5
"
  One of the BEST shows ever written and the acting is second to NONE, you will enjoy every episode. All hail the king!!!
",5
"
  Great!
",5
"
  The acting, the filming, the sound tracks, the cinematography is all spectacular. This is a well written show. Must see.
",5
"
  I know I'm in the minority but I am not a fan. Just didn't enjoy it. Only watched 2 seasons, but have no interest in watching further. Well acted however.
",3
"
  It shows a picture of a blue ray.  Its NOT blue ray.

"
  Just started watching Breaking Bad from Season 1-5. They are all awesome. Great viewing.  Exciting, thrilling and exceptional acting on all parts.
",5
"
  I am really enjoying this series. I'd missed it when first broadcast but it's really nice to watch as many episodes as I have time for at once. I never get tired of it.
",5
"
  totally addicted to this series. Like everyone else i know.
",5
"
  OMG, this show gets better and better. We watch 2 or 3 episodes per night. Don't know how it could get any better.
",5
"
  The unique story grabs your attention and holds it.  The writers and actors make it interesting.  not a show for young kids.
",4
"
  A friend recommended this series.  I was hooked after the first couple of episodes.  Can't wait for Summer 2013 to see how it all ends!
",5
"
  Painful situations and unlikeable characters.  Not for me.
",3
"
  Great storytelling!
",5
"
  You'll have to get all the seasons once you've been hooked on season one. Well written and well acted. Enjoy.
",5
"
  great series
",5
"
  Addicting! Some people say it takes a few episodes to get into it, but I was hooked after the second one. Really intriguing!!!
",5
"
  I came into the Breaking Bad series towards the end of Season One and was so taken by it that I had to order the full season.  This is the tale of a high school chemistry teacher turning his scientific skills into a profitable drug-making operation in order to finance his expensive cancer treatments.  He enlists the help of a former student to market the resulting product.  Along the way, they encounter violence, close calls (his brother-in-law is a DEA agent), and some hilarious missteps.This is a very well-crafted series with fascinating characters, all portrayed by excellent actors.  Season Three is coming up. If you watch it once, you'll be hooked!
",5
"
  one of the best shows in recently history.
",5
"
  Awesome series.  It competes very favorably with my other favorite show, Dexter.  I am totally hooked.  Well acted, well written and well presented!
",5
"
  What can I say that everyone else hasn't said.  Hooks you from the pilot and never, ever jumps the shark through the entire season.
",5
"
  Nothing can beat Breaking Bad as the best thing on tv, absolutely nothing. And this starts it all off. Wish I could go back and unsee it so I could start all over again!
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is the best TV show I have seen ... excellent acting, cinematography, script, etc ... all around a very enjoyable experience in every season,
",5
"
  Just started watching it with the gf. Intense. Also Cranston is an amazing actor considering he was the father on malcom.
",5
"
  This show keeps you interested all season long! Lots of plots going on, that all flow together quite nicely. I just love all the charactors. The combination of great writers and actors make this a must see.
",5
"
  great
",5
"
  It held our interest for the show and we will be watching all episodes.  It seemed so possible for someone to get themselves in trouble like that before they realized what was going on.
",5
"
  Fist paced, well acted, real.
",5
"
  Fantastic storyline, great acting, good dialog.  A fantastic value at this price! Would definitely recommend this to all of my friends and family.
",5
"
  Intense enough I can only watch 1 episode a day. Good combination of tense moments versus ridiculous comedy. I.F.T. episode is a great 'gotcha'.
",5
"
  Good show
",5
"
  Was a very good product and met expectations. It worked very well and did what it said it would do.
",5
"
  I had never seen the show, but after all the hoopla of the final season, I decided to check it out. Count me hooked.
",5
"
  Pretty good - not great like some people claim.
",4
"
  GREAT SERIES AND FAST SHIPPING
",5
"
  Great series about a mans demise into the world of drugs trying to save his family interesting, funny, captivating a must see
",4
"
  I started watching breaking bad a couple years ago. Bought this to catch up. Best show ever on tv....and sadly it's now over.
",5
"
  I don't usually watch this type of entertainment, but this show is so well written and acted its almost addictive.  It makes one realize how close to diving over the edge the so called ""normal"" person actually is.
",5
"
  tried to get in to it but i fizzled out
",3
"
  Was like a good book, couldn't put it down.  Once me and my son started watching, we wound up staying up past midnight to finish an episode.  Not disappointed.
",5
"
  Viewing Season 1 of the show was very interesting and I was looking forward to streaming the other episodes but I was put off after seeing that although I'm a prime subscriber that the subsequent episodes are not free for streaming to prime members.  I think that charging members who have already paid for prime subscription is absurd and while I'm anxious to and wanted very much to view the following episodes, I'm not going to pay for something that should be free not only me, but to other prime subscribers.Breaking Bad I found to be very provocative and I can see why it was so popular and won so many awards.  I'm very sorry that I won see the remaining episodes.
",5
"
  This is the best TV series I've seen since The Sopranos.  The acting is wonderful. The story line is interesting.  I can't wait to watch Season 2.
",5
"
  Its Breaking Bad-- who could not get hooked on this series!!?  Such a fasinating script, and tons to discuss afterwards!
",5
"
  Oh my gosh, this show is SO ADDICTIVE!  I watched all 5 seasons back to back in a very short period of time.  5-stars all around - AWESOME show!!!
",5
"
  Hi FolksBreaking Bad is one amazing show! The acting is wonderful, the casting inspired, but whoever writes this subtle nuanced layered story about a Chemistry teacher cooking meth, is brilliant.The Chemistry teacher is told he has cancer and only a short time to live & so begins cooking meth to build a nestegg for his family.It can be brutal, and at first I thought this would be a dark comedy. While it does have it's funny moments, this is a pretty serious drama. WELL DONE! It is one of my favorite shows!Watch this series!
",5
"
  Crazy show but so well written and great actors, characters that it's a big hit.
",5
"
  It doesn't get any better than this series. Awesome!
",5
"
  great stuff!
",5
"
  Breaking Bad; Buy it, watch it, and love it.Breaking Bad is so good; its bad.WARNING: you will be hooked !!
",5
"
  My husband down-loaded this (first time to do this for a TV show).  Got hooked.  Ended up down-loading the second season too.
",5
"
  Awesome series and great price/quick international delivery
",5
"
  An excellent series...well-written and acted...can't wait for more! Season 2 is waiting for me! Words can't describe it..the best ever.
",5
"
  Great Product
",5
"
  to see how the characters grow and or change in this series is something most tv lacks ...... mustsee this from the beginning
",5
"
  Son-in-law liked it.
",5
"
  What a great series this was, I couldn't stop watching it. I just wish it didn't have to end. A GREAT series for sure.
",5
"
  I would highly recommend this series to anyone!  It is so addicting!  My boyfriend and I have watched 2 complete seasons in less than a week!!
",5
"
  It's as good as everyone said it is.
",5
"
  Bought this as a gift and he loves it!  You can't go wrong with the best television series in years!
",5
"
  Is intensely entertaining, and disturbingly delightful!  I find it to be a unique spin on an old story of a good person gone bad.
",5
"
  Excellent story! SO happy with my purchase! :-)
",5
"
  What's to say really? It's Walt and Jesse doing what they do. If you own one, you must own all. GREAT SHOW!!
",5
"
  Great season.  Can't wait to watch the next one!
",5
"
  As Expected
",5
"
  Loved it!
",5
"
  I have only watched the first three episodes of Season One. It is great television in the mold of The Sopranos and The Wire. The writing is superb and intelligent viewers will appreciate the sly humor. Can't wait to discover what all the hype has been about.
",5
"
  Should be on everyone's bucket list to see.
",5
"
  In the way of a good novel, Breaking Bad is a completely unbelievable story about very, very true ideas.  Not since Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, honestly, has TV been so moving.  The word ""epic"" comes to mind.  And multilayered, complex, dark, and serious -- only making the comic moments more laugh-out-loud funny.Warning: This thing is dirty.  That's why I'm watching it with someone I love.But it's also Beethoven.  Michelangelo.  If you want kid stuff, tune in to the Disney channel.  This -- this is for grown-ups.  There has never, ever been a TV series so masterfully written, directed, filmed and acted.
",5
"
  Quick and as advertised. I loved it.
",5
"
  I rarely buy series dvds but loved this show so much I decided to buy the DVD--very good series and I was very confident ordering it from Amazon.

  A classic series,this is how Walter White went bad,I mean he broke bad..

  Bought this for a friends birthday & I know he'll love it. There is no reason to not love this series!!! :)

  My friend recommended me the series. It starts out very slow. But it quickly turns around. Then you can see why this show is still going
",5
"
  Best show ever
",5
"
  Met my expectations

  I received it on time and in good condition, but it is still waiting to be viewed. I seem to have a stack of things to watch and read.

",5
"
  great show, couldn't stop watching it.
",5
"
  Been wanting to watch this series for awhile now  and Amazon prime worked very well - and the show was great!
",5
"
  No further explanation needed other than 5 stars!  Great series and great cast! I would recommend this series to serious drama fans.
",5
"
  you cant go wrong with breaking bad, I started watching and couldn't stop,  seems to be the theme with this series
",5

  My family and I re-watch this series on a regular basis.  Great Story, excellent actors.  So Sorry it is no longer on the air.

  Incredible.

  Buy it!! The best show in the last 5 years IMHO. Gripping drama. Leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for final season
",5
"
  timely deliver, great price excellent look.
",5
"
  I love that the bluray is uncensored. Obviously great show
",5
"
  Good story, great actors, quality show !Watch how the madness unfolds and how Walter White becomes the great Heisenberg O: !
",5
"
  Smart, unexpected and can't wait to watch more!  After hearing about this show I found myself buying it for a trip.  Excellent scripting and it shows what can drive an ordinary person to start living a secret illegal life.
",5
"
  I never watched the show when it was new but I'm addicted to it now.  I'm sure I'll watch the series more than once.
",5
"
  great price. bought complete set for my son. all seasons. very happy
",5
"
  This is one of the best TV shows of all time, in my opinion.
",5
"
  Yup
",5
"
  Great acting and interesting plot.
",4
"
  I highly recommend if you like intensity.  The first episode was a little hard to get into, but the show had to build up the characters.Very good entertainment...crazy!
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is the best tv show ever!
",5
"
  If you have yet to watch this show, you have no idea what you are missing.  Everything you *think* you know about it, isn't true at all.  The only way to experience the brilliance is to watch it from the very start.
",5
"
  I bought this as a gift for a friend.. This was one of my favorite shows when it was on TV. Smart, funny (at times), suspenseful, and emotionally gripping.
",5
"
  This is an excellent series.  I don't know what turned me off when it first came out.  I think it was the title.The dvd does not support closed captioning in English.
",5
"
  I have heard everyone talking about this show and how great it is. We have only watched 3 episodes--we are hooked-- it is so unexpected and great to watch. We love it.Can not wait to see more
",5
"
  FRIEND RECOMMENDED. He was mesmerized by the story, the characters and action.  In fact, two friends swore by this series.
",5
"
  This set arrived very quickly. It is to be a gift so I won't be opening it. I watched the series on TV and love it.
",5
"
  Wow!
",5
"
  The story of a mild-mannered school teacher.  He fins he is dying and decides to cook Meth to make money for his family.
",5
"
  One of the strangest things I've watched. Clearly a great series.
",4
"
  it is easy to see why this series has been nominated for many awards in several categories...the bottom line...very arresting plot driven by great acting performances...
",5
"
  Interesting characters with excellent acting.  This story line takes many unexpected turns and can be very dark, but thoroughly entertaining.
",5
"
  Wish I started watching it back when it was new but never too late. Thinking about buying the 2nd season.
",5
"
  Outstanding !!!  Story, screenplay, casting and acting were flawless !! Will win a place with the ultimo classics !
",5
"
  for years, my friends have told me i should watch this show and i always have said ""i can't start another show"".  well, you can't go wrong with this series and the price was right for the season.  now we are waiting for season 2
",5
"
  great show
",5
"
  You will be addicted, and you will have to purchase all the seasons and watch them over and over and over. It is that good.
",5
"
  How on earth did it take me this long to watch ""Breaking Bad""???!!!  The acting is phenomenal, and the action keeps you compulsively watching to see what happens next!!!
",5
"
  Worth the time and money to rent.  If you like Homeland, the Big C, with very good scripts and acting. then watch this.
",5
"
  I received the product in a timely fashion and the product was as described.  I got a great deal and look forward to receiving the other seasons on Bluray as well.
",5
"
  Had heard about the series for years. I finally decided to purchase ""session 1"" DVDs. Was not dissatisfied.
",4
"
  You will need all the seasons for sure.  Great Series it will pull you right in for the next season.
",5
"
  This a great TV show, in my humble opinion. I bought the DVD based on a 3 min. commercial I saw a year ago and I wasn't disappointed. This is definitely a one man show, where Bryan Cranston cranks out the role of his life. Don't expect to laugh much though, this sure isn't Weeds. Just when our ""hero's"" life couldn't get any worse, it sure does! Enjoy
",4
"
  Love Breaking Bad!!
",5
"
  Wow! great show!
",5
"
  The whole season was awesome!!!
",5
"
  Just finished season one and started season two. Was convinced to try watching by my daughter. She was right it is addictive! ( no pun intended)
",5
"
  Best show on cablle.
",5
"
  great show
",5
"
  Best series ever
",5
"
  My Nephew recommended the show, and I am very picky of what I watch as I value my time greatly.  I was trully impressed definetely buying all the seasons.
",5
"
  good
",5
"
  Enjoyed every episode.  Just couldn't get enough Breaking Bad.  My husband and I just finished the entire season and wish there were more episodes.
",5
"
  thank you fine service
",5
"
  Fantastic show.  Crisp writing, smart dialog.  Characters were well defined.
",5
"
  accidentally tripped up on this as AMC was running the show from beginning the week the series finale showed.  Great sleeper find.
",5
"
  The season that started everything for Walt. I suggest you watch this if you are into action, and drama. What a great show.
",5
"
  My husband ordered me the complete series from Amazon for Christmas.  I was so sad when the show went off the air but now I can watch it anytime I want :)
",5
"
  My son turned me onto this series..once I started watching it I could not get enough. I bought all the previous season episodes too.
",5
"
  This is a great series. Got this really fast and in great condition. I would but again and will for the other seasons
",5
"
  Discs look good - haven't watched them yet
",5
"
  This is the best show on TV.  I am very sad that it will be ending but will get every season on DVD to watch again someday.
",5
"
  Exactly what I was expecting.  I was not disappointed.
",5
"
  Absolutely insane. Like weeds on meth. haha So far its good and ill be back for seasons 2 and 3 so dont wait up for me.
",5
"
  Has anyone buying this not watched the show already? This is show is one of the greatest dramas of all time. I rank it #2.
",5
"
  The stakes are high, the acting and directing are superb, the writing is Shakespearean...what more could one ask for in a TV series?
",5
"
  What a TV show this is.  Excellent cast and incredible story.  I rarely watch regular TV- it's often so silly, but this show is great.
",5
"
  The sneak preview looks REALLY GOOD, and my brother (who loves quirky twisted stuff as much as I do) gave the series a raving review.  Count me IN!
",5
"
  I loved it but it really was upsetting at the same time.  The subject matter was harsh and far to realistic
",5
"
  I am ADDICTED and so is my husband (to ""Breaking Bad"", not meth). This show is so well written and such a nail-biter that we sit like starving squirrels nervously stuffing our faces while the hour's story unravels. It's terrible! But so much fun! We couldn't believe Walt was actually Bryan Cranston from ""Malcom in the Middle"". Sheesh -- talk about flabbergasting. Cranston has an incredible range and is a stunningly impressive actor. My mom is a librarian and says these DVDs fly off the shelves at work. Sadly, my husband and I have this theory that when we like a show it's sure to go off the air. Gosh I hope not ...  Start watching this folks! It's spectacular!
",5
"
  Love this show.  Started watching after seeing this show win so many Emmy's.  Very entertaining.
",5
"
  good show, one of the best
",5
"
  wow, the creators of this are awesome and so up to date on life in the streets, thugs, and chemistry.
",5
"
  just an incredible series with great acting and a great storyline if you haven't seen it make sure you do. you won't be sorry (NOT FOR KIDS)
",5
"
  I was hooked on this show from Scene 1 and it doesn't disappoint all the way through! Buy it now!
",5
"
  Best tv series out there
",5
"
  great, thanks!
",5
"
  With great writing, great acting and a refreshingly different premise - oh, and incredible cinematography - Breaking Bad is the bomb! I find myself watching it every chance I get. Very, very clever.
",5
"
  Great series.  I was hooked after the first season.  Very cleverly written and characters flawed enough to be almost real.
",5
"
  You will want to buy the while season. We started with this one and marathoned the seasons till the end.
",5
"
  What can you say?This whole series is so creative and so unique it almost creates a new frontierCongratulations!
",4
"
  I""m obsessed after watching the first episode.  One of the best, if not the best, series of all time.  Fabulous acting and writing.
",5
"
  VERY, very  good!!!!
",5
"
  Edgy.
",5
"
  always keeps you hook in even when you want to quit like...like some kind of drug
",5
"
  Episode One will not play.

"
  Got on the band wagon late and missed first few.  Great to be able to back track so you can ""tie-in"" what and why is going on.
",5
"
  I like the series very much and the DVD is clean and uncut. A real joy to watch on my free time.
",5
"
  The show is riveting from the very beginning of each episode.  I have to prepare myself to watch it because it is so intense.
",4
"
  Be prepared to watch every season as you wont be able to stop watching!
",5
"
  Oh, no.  Why did I get started watching this?  I'm hooked!
",5
"
  Love it
",5
"
  it was intereesting, but i wouldnt pay for to watch this..  it should have more than one situation in easch episdoe.
",5
"
  One of the few series I like.  To bad it's over!  Walt and Jessie can't be any better.  Gotta see!
",5
"
  Great!
",5
"
  Wish it wasn't cancelled. Was great 8 sesons to watch! Anyone who orders this will enjoy watching it. Very addicting, you have to watch all 8 sesons.
",5
"
  This is like Meth for your eyes, the series is addictive
",5
"
  Watching it for the second time- It's still so good!
",5
"
  Nice to be able to watch all of this season on my time...this is all I want to say on this.
",5
"
  Love it.
",5
"
  This was purchased as a gift for my son in law.  It arrived very fast.  I will borrow it when they are done watching.
",5
"
  Great show - couldn't stop watching. Very engaging. I watched 4 shows back to back. Look forward to watching all the seasons episodes.

  Loved this, just started watching it, finished the season in 1 day and hurriedly ordered the other seasons. Did the same with them!!!

  Compelling TV brilliantly acted.

"
  ☆☆☆☆GREAT SELLER 100% RECOMMENDED☆☆☆☆
",5
"
  Love this show, never seen the first season so I wanted to start from the beginning. Alot of violence tho.
",5
"
  I found the show compelling and unique. I would recommend this show to people that enjoy Dexter or lovers of an antihero role. I have yet to see the rest of season (due to school), but plan on finishing it when I have time.
",4
"
  what i said for the fith season goes for all of themi truly recomend it, you'll have a very, very good time.
",5
"
  Very entertaining
",5
"
  This is the best show ever! Addicted after the first episode
",5
"
  My wife talked me into watching this series, as the advertisement picture just seemed weird to me. But I was completely surprised by the quality and entertainment value of this show. The story line and acting are excellent, and I highly recommend this adult series. My biggest disappointment were only 7 episodes in the first year, On to year 2 over the week-end, the show is so good, you have to resist watching more than one episode at a time.
",5
"
  Gift for family that liked the series. No complaint with discs at all.
",4
"
  I am stoked on this show.  I do not even have to convince anyone. Everybody knows how great it is.
",5
"
  Awesome writing,and Bryan Cranston was totally on his game. The entire cast made this show one of the best on tv,ever.
",5
"
  best ever
",5
"
  Season 1 got us hooked.  Now, in a short period of time we have watched the whole series of season -- we were sad to watch the last episode!
",5
"
  This is one of my favorite series. It has great writing and it keeps you at the edge of your seat. If you haven't seen this show, but it!!!
",5
"
  what is there to say

  You should see this show! It is one of a kind! Makes you wonder realy, ppl would do that for money! but stil a nice show great story line!

  BEST DRAMA SERIES EVER, BETTER THAN ANYTHING ON SHOWTIME, HBO, CABLE. A++ rating good stuff makes it worth the watch

  Great story

"
  Favorite tv show series. Bought it for Valentine's Day for my bf. He loved it. Shopping was very fast.
",5
"
  Really interesting story,  Never able to anticipate what might happen next.  Suburb acting.  New Mexico backdrop makes it seem even more authentic.
",4
"
  One of the all time best series on TV. Not to be missed.
",5
"
  Never watched this show before.  Just started from the beginning.  Now I see what all the fuss is about.  Very good entertainment.
",4
"
  A very engaging show, I’m glad I’ve finally started to watch it!
",5
"
  Want to see additional seasons, it took a few episodes before I could decide if I liked it or not
",4
"
  I finally got the time to get into this series...all that I've read was true. Cranston is mesmerising as Walter White. I watched the 1st season and quickly ordered the rest (pre-ordering the final This cannot be missed
",5
"
  I never watched but recently heard a few people tell it is good.  I decided to give it a try and actually liked it.
",4
"
  Yes, it's that good. It's sometimes funny, often gritty, and always compelling. It's the TV version of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. I usually wait until a few episodes queue up on my DVR so I can watch them all at once, because at the end of every show I can't wait to see what happens next. Some of the supporting performances are a bit thin, but they don't detract from Cranston's and Paul's incredible talent.
",5
"
  im hooked. amaxing.
",5
"
  I loved this series on AMC.  Being able to re-watch this series is a lot of fun for me.  True.
",5
"
  Excellent script. Unpredictable. Great actors. I'm hooked! I look forward to watching this entire series. The story line is real and fascinating. An indepth look at society and all it's flaws, is what makes this show so real.
",5
"
  I was too busy to sit and watch this well written show, when season 1 first came out. Still busy but have to take a break for my  BB time.
",5
"
  This is an intriguing series that I missed so I'm getting caught up.
",5
"
  If you get through season 1...you'll want more! Highly recommend.
",5
"
  The best show in the history of television. That's a fact, Jack.
",5
"
  there is no not loving Breaking Bad
",5
"
  It's ok... about what I was expecting. It's pretty violent, for a TV show... I would like to see more comical moments.

"
  It's addicting
",5
"
  Keeps you shaking your head with awe and disbelief. Totally un**believably krazy!
",5
"
  Breaking Bad has to be the best TV show I've every watched.  Watch the whole thing in sequence, and pay attention to the details!  BRILLIANT!!!The lower star review is because the version sold here is ed*ted, and I got sick of the numerous bl**ps and fuzzed-out b*dy p**ts.  Seriously interfered with appreciation of the acting and the character development.  I watched this on N*****x, where the uncensored version is available!

  I just want to say that this show is genius. Kind of a mix up between the wire and weeds but a little more dark. Definitely worth your time.
",5
"
  Great TV show, had to find out what all the talk was about.
",5
"
  I loved this show! If you have never seen it, this is a must buy. After watching 3 episoldes in season 1, I was hooked. I haven't seen a show this good in 10 years.
",5
"
  I wasn't expecting it to be so addictive but I ended up watching all the episodes over a three day period.
",5
"
  definitely recommend this show and blu ray to anyone.  If you're going to watch a great show, may as well watch it on blu ray. Enjoy!
",5

  I can watch this over and over.

  If you haven't seen this show you must binge the whole series.

  Interesting look into what if a mousey, unambitious teacher gets pushed because he's fed up with his life and always struggling to make ends meet. Finds out he has terminal lung cancer and decides to leave his family with something besides a pile of bills. Runs into formser student turned meth dealer and decides to cook meth with Walt as producer and his former student as front man. Show is a roller coaster ride, from funny to pathetic to scary.  You feel bad for Walt cuz he ge s teased and s*** on by everyone from his smart-ass DEA agent brother-in-law to the students in his chemistry class. It's scary because of the cracked-out hoods he has to deal with to sell his junk, the situations are laughable, albeit pathetic. It's a sad commentary on contemporary society, its sort of a parody of everything bad. After I'm done with it, it will probably be on sale on e-bay, if ya'll wanna wait a few week and buy off me, I'll give ya a good deal! lol. It's an interesting work, somewhat entertaining, but nothing i will want to hang onto, I doubt I will buy the rest of the series. I'll save my money and buy the complete Sopranos that I never watched all the episodes of. This isnt a badly produced show, I just dont like the subject matter, as Im very much anti-drugs and there is too much gratuitous violence in it. If you like a fair amount of violence and like to watch bad-ass beaners beat the s*** out of everyone in site, you'll love this series.

  The quality of the video is high, very clear, no freezing, or glitches.  Highly recommend the speed of viewing capability whenever I miss an episode.

  This show is awesome! Began watching series somewhere during the 3rd season and have to say this show has kept me on the edge of my seat through this current season 5! Ordered seasons 1 & 2 as gift for hsbnd and to get more background on Walt's character. Sunday can't come soon enough where this show is concerned!
",5
"
  This is one of the best shows I have ever seen! The content of the show is very entertaining if not mesmerizing, but what really sets it apart is the awesome character development throughout the cast. From little known to relatively unknown actors/actresses,I was blown away by their performances throughout. Watch it, watch it, watch it!!

  This season got me hooked on them all. Entertaining engaging and thought provoking. Give it a try I bet you will be hooked too.

  Great! Just started watching and my husband and I are hooked!

  I really like this guy's character when he was on Malcolm in the Middle so I decided to check this show out.  It is an interesting show and I will continue to watch the other few seasons.
",5
"
  Great series especially on AMC, not one of the networks I normally watch when I had cable. Great characters and story almost rivaling Sons of Anarchy which is my favorite show.

  Fabulous. Can't wait to finish it.

  I was addicted and watched all 5/6 seasons in about 2 weeks.

  One of the best series' ever created. A mix of drama, suspense, comedy/dark comedy, and a giant dose of reality when it comes to how a real family is. I love Breaking Bad, the actors are phenomenal, the dialogue is phenomenal, and the story is incredible. You won't waste your time with this series, it teaches you as much as entertains you.

  Awesome show and I highly recommend it!

  I caught some episodes of Breaking Bad on AMC. Got addicted and had to buy all the DVDS to watch it all! ONe of the best I have ever seen!

  We have already finished this first season. I had to order the nest 3 seasons already. Great price and great show. This was shipped super fast as well.
",5
"
  A very good series. Interesting and makes you want to watch more of that one. However, a waste of money on this store. Get Netflix and watch it.

  if u haven't seen this get off your ass and start watching best series in a long time love it

  Hooked and addicted by first episode

  I was'nt sure if there would be another series that I enjoyed as much as the sopranos but this filled the void.

  people told me that I just had to watch this show... now we are hooked.fast shipping and the product was NIB as advertised.

  Excellent transaction

  Perfect

  Was provoked by the first season's programs, so ordered the next five seasons as well.
",5
"
  Full of action, suspense, romance...this series leaves you on the edge of your seat. I would totally suggest this to any adult.
",5
"
  When I first heard about the storyline for this show I thought ""What?!?""  But it really works. Bryan Cranston does a fabulous job as Walter White
",5
"
  I loved Breaking Bad the first time I watched it on Netflix. I thought I would watch the whole series a second time (it's that good!) on Amazon for better quality and surround sound.Well I got that, and LESS! The first episode I watched on Amazon (the pilot episode) is CENSORED! I couldn't believe it! They bleeped out all of the F-bombs. And in one brief scene with nudity (where Jesse is climbing out of an upstairs window to escape the DEA raid), they digitally covered up a topless woman in the window.I don't like watching censored shows. Amazon should have made it very clear that their version was censored. It's not censored on Netflix, so I'll watch the rest of the episodes there for free.It's a great show - watch it on Netflix.

"
  This show is riveting! Good premise, sympathetic characters, and well written. Check your pulse if you do not find yourself hooked.
",5
"
  Intense!

  I tuned in to Breaking Bad at season 4.  It was great to catch up starting with season 1.  What an amazingly brilliant series.
",5
"
  Great show!!

"
  Just starting by so far it has my attention!

"
  Can't wait to see all.

  This show is excellent.  It's edgy, brilliantly written and the cast is great.  Worth watching.  Starts slow but ramps quickly.
",5
"
  I haven't given this yet  since this this is a Christmas gift and I am sure he will love it!
",5
"
  Season one immerses the viewer in a compelling tale with interesting characters, believable situations, and a strong desire to keep watching.
",5
"
  This is the first TV show I have enjoyed in a very long time. Always something new yet very easy to follow.
",5
"
  Absolutely addictive!
",5
"
  Heard rave comments from friends so I watched with great anticipation.  After the first 4 episodes I was not drawn in to the series as I had hoped.  The characters are not very interesting to me. I am a Banshee fan.
",3
"
  With the end of the series at hand I wanted to revisit the first season for any insight. It's amazing how well the series was staged in the first season. This wild journey with Walt and Jesse and Skyler et al unfolds with piercing drama and errie foreshadowing. The surprising humor leaves you questioning your moral compass, something I miss in the later seasons.
",5
"
  I only learned of breaking bad recently, and saw a few of the newer episodes. I knew I couldn't really appreciate the series until I started from the beginning, and I am glad I did. It is great so far, and I'm looking forward to purchasing the second season!
",5
"
  GREAT!  thanks.  A+

  Gets better every episode.

  This is a GREAT series.  It has everything, drama, comedy, . . .  Watch it.

"
  Season 1 has gotten me curious.  I wouldn't say I'm hooked but I am curious to see where this show goes.  On to season 2...

  When I watched the 1st episode I was hooked, Breaking Bad is Bad.

  Each episode a dramatic jewel. Would recommend to anyone. Same words as my comments on season one episodes. I have already ordered seasons three and four.

  Awesome show with a lot of very light and funny moments mixed in with dark and frightening moments.  Many twists and turns as you watch the lead character Walt, concerned family man morph into an almost psychopathic meth dealer.  There are a couple of holes in the writing which make you draw your own conclusions, but I think that is from the budget of AMC and the limit on amount of shows.  This would be Soprano-esque had HBO picked it up to develop.  Well worth the price!!!

  After all of the hype, I was somewhat disapointed viewing first few episodes of season one - but It's getting better and growing on me.

"
  Breaking Bad season one, in only seven episodes, shows what a great television show can be. But it's not just great,it's superior to anything I have ever seen on TV and is probably better than 90-95% of any movies that come out in a given year, no exaggeration. Before I even saw the last episode I ordered season 2 hahaha. A great buy, really.
",5
"
  Best First Show for any show ever!
",5
"
  Totally hooked!

  The start of the best show! One cannot start in the middle of this series. Have to watch from the very beginning to fully grasp the storyline. This season and every one after is a must have. Impeccable writing!

  The price was right for this season. I will buy the other seasons at Target because they are cheaper than Amazon.

  completely unimaginable, the leap over the wall of straight and narrow that walt white makes -- in order to protect and provide for his family.  ""breaking bad"" proves to show us just how fine the line that we walk can be --- when desparate times call for desparate measure -- and we've got nothing else to lose.

  ""Breaking Bad"" is totally awesome. Who hasn't day dreamed about a taking a short cut to wealth? And this show depicts the pros and cons of such a decision. There were many times when I was laughing hysterically, although I'm not sure that the writers of the show intended to get such a reaction at all such times. Bought season 1 & 2. Can't wait for season 3 on blu-ray.

  came as expected. no issues. arrived on time and in good condition. one of the best shows on tv. i suggest all the seasons

"
  amazingly written and directed
",5
"
  This is a great way to get introduced to a great show like Breaking Bad.  Season 1 is only 7 episodes but a lot happens and you'll be hooked after the opening intro for episode 1.  Also, lots of extra goodies on here that make the DVD purchase well worth it.

"
  This has to be the best Series I have watched!! Awesome!!
",5
"
  Excellent gift for someone who likes ""Sons of Anarchy"".  My brother-in-law was thrilled to received this! Tip--this show is not for anyone who dislikes violent, R-rated shows.
",5
"
  I've only watched two episodes but I have already ordered the second season and plan on ordering the third season.Both shocking and entertaining at once!!!So far - I love itMorgan

  One of the best shows currently on television, and probably one of the best shows of all time.  Excellent writing and acting, plus a story line that never bores or disappoints.

  Great series!

  wife loved it

  Very pleased!

  My wife didn't start watching until the last season, so she gets it fresh. Instant video is a great way to own the series, so many options as to how to watch.

  the best

  This has it all,humour,pathos ,action and some terrific acting.This surpasses my other favourite series,including Six feet under,Justified and even the Sopranos.
",5
"
  Great series!  Played perfectly.
",5
"
  This is an absolutely compelling series; currently being televised on AMC (American Movie Classics) as an original series on Sunday at 10:00pm. I bought this DVD set on the recommendation from a friend and I was hooked by the storyline, excellent script, dialogue and supporting cast.This is the best series that I have watched since Six Feet Under and Dexter. This series and the aforementioned detail why cable and premium channels are so relevant to viewers.
",5
"
  So far, so good.

"
  Reminds us Breaking Bad fans where it all started and the addiction starts here. The best writing of any recent episodic TV show.  Bryan Cranston recently said ""I will never get to play such a complex character again.""

"
  Thank you

  good deal.

  There are no english sub-titles.  My husband is hard of hearing makes it hard for him to enjoy it.  I ordered allthe season's.  I'll be able to enjoy them but he want.

  It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first show.  It's also has a sense of humor considering all the bad things that are happening.

  About half way through S1 and am loving it! Keeps me on the edge of my seat. My only complaint is that I am TOO addicted.

  Highly Recommend! Fast delivery! Exactly as described!

  It gets better after the first season

"
  This show will grab you from the very beginning! I never got to see the series during its' run, but I had heard it was one of cable's best. Now, be aware that this is cable and the language restrictions are less strong. If coarse language offends you, you might want to stay away from this. However, the story gets your attention from the start and the acting is spot on.
",5
"
  The best acted, scripted, and produced made for TV series ever.  Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul are amazing.  Another binge watch special!
",5
"
  I really enjoy the suspense of the show so far…I am already into season two! If you were a fan of the Sopranos I think you would also enjoy Breaking Bad. I was a huge fan of the Sopranos.
",5
"
  excellent. Have been watching in bits and pieces so it has been good to start at the beginning and see it all
",5
"
  Awesome!  I held out watching this for a long time, and now I can not get enough. Gonna keep watching!!!
",5
"
  i bought this for my husband for christmas and he watched it all! I got the all 6 seasons and he watched it all and it only took 4 days!!! He usually goes to bed at 7:00 and he stayed up until 2: am watching this!!! 5 stars!
",5
"
  What a show!  Twists and turns in the plot-characters that have no redeming qualities but you get ""addicted"" to them, wondering what will happen next.  Great, great series.  You can't go wrong watching this.

  binged watched this its good!

  I really loved the whole series - and would like to see a whole lot more like this on TV.

  Thumbs up

  At times I did not know whether to be upset or to laugh. The story lines are very different. A chemistry teacher who is an apparent underachiever becomes a methamphetamine producer. He also happens to have a brother-in-law who is a DEA agent. He also works in a car wash after school. because he are desperate for money. The teacher's wife is about 40 and pregnant. The couple has one child, a son, who has difficulty walking and speaking. And the series starts from there.  What king of maniac writers could come up with ideas like this. It is definitely a story about something. The acting is excellent.I loved the chemical element graphics that were used for letters in various names and scientific topics that were weaved throughout several episodes. Overall just a great series..

  I saw all the awards this show won and had to see for myself.  I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it so I watched an episode on TV.  I was immediately hooked. I had to watch from the beginning.  I received it quickly and it was in great condition!

  That's the best part. It takes ordinary people-- high school teacher, society woman, a cerebral palsy teenager (ordinary?) a bad ass righteous cop and cheap ugly street thugs--and puts them together into a crystal meth trip.

  I viewed Breaking Bad on Netflix because I could not get past the introduction to Breaking Bad on Amazon, even though I paid the $11.99 fee for the first season.  Netflix provided a smooth transition between segments so I intend to view the rest of the segments on Netflix.

  I caught the first episode of Breaking Bad and I was hooked. Never had I thought a series about a chemistry teacher turned to a life of crime would work but this does seem to work. The title fits he's ""Breaking Bad"".

  This was a great buy in my opinion. Shipping was really fast and is eligible for free shipping. I love the tv show and seeing it on bluray makes it much better. It is truly a great buy if your a fan and makes an awesome gift too. I would reccommend this product to my friends and family interested in it.

  This series is the best on TV right now.  After Deadwood left, there was nothing to watch until Breaking Bad showed up.

  I heard about Breaking Bad from a co-worker.  I watched the minisodes on Hulu and then bought the Season 1 DVD set.  The show is entertaining, intriguing and all the actors do a fantastic job.  I can't wait to watch more of Season 2.  We saw Aaron Paul in Hollywood at a local store - love living in the same city as the talent!

  Breaking Bad is truly a terrific show, it has absolutely everything I could wish for in a TV series. At no point is there a lack of drama and suspense or even comedy, it's simply a perfect mix of all of the above, from beginning to end of the first season.What some have mentioned already is the camera work. There is a subtlety to it that makes it an immense pleasure to just watch the screen as it sucks you right into the story, and once you're in there, you'll be drooling over more of it. It's truly addictive!And of course not to mention the brilliant performance of Bryan Cranston. But also the rest of the cast is very, very good and without a doubt worth mentioning.Some minor pacing issues aside, this is great television and one of the best currently running.

"
  Only watched the first two episodes, starting to get hooked!
",5
"
  This entire series is awesome!
",5

  It starts out pretty far out there but begins to shape up as a serious story before the season ends. One is torn between the two extreme lives Walter is living particularly as it relates to his wife.

  Started off slow but grabbed my attention quickly and I can't wait to see all seasons!!

  This is different than your regular TV show.  You are hanging on the edge or your seat wondering how Walt and Jesse will get out their predicaments. One of the interesting things is that this is not far fetched.  This could happen to your local Highschool Chemistry Teacher.  You never know what will happen next. This, and Season Two, is worth purchasing.  Bryan Cranston (Walt) just won an emmy.  I'm stoked for Season Three. Breaking Bad is way above any drama on TV.

  I'm told by EVERYONE that this series is awesome.  I have watched the entire first season and I'm wondering what all the fuss is about.  I'm told that I just have to keep watching and that it gets better, so I have purchased the second season and I'll see what that does for me.

  It has been a bit slow to start but it is a great show. I heard it gets so much better!

  The bar that was set for television with shows like The Sopranos and The Wire has been taken up a notch with Breaking Bad.  Like both of those shows, its characters are realistically drawn and believably acted by amazing casts (as noted by many, particularly Brian Cranston's ""Walt"").  What seemingly began as a somewhat simplistic premise in season one rises to the level of engrossing thriller by the end of season two - and then to the level of Shakespearian Tragedy by the end of season Three.  The character arc of Walter White from complacent and defeated suburbanite to calculating criminal is one of the most rewarding rides I've ever experienced in any form of fiction (TV shows/movies/novels).The reason I say the bar is taken up a notch is not because I think it's better than the shows I mentioned (persa).  There is a bit of ""apples and oranges"" in comparing any TV show to another.  It's because Breaking Bad easily on par, yet accomplishes its greatness sort of with one hand tied behind its back.  HBO has the freedom as a premium channel to be as vulgar or graphic as the story dictates... nearly uncensored.  AMC (who produces Breaking Bad) works within much more restrictive limits, yet feels every bit as gritty and intense as those other shows.  And I'm not sure that seeing the occasional naked person or cussing rant could do much to improve upon it (though I'm certainly not against either =)Unlike in some shows, Walt's amazing character arc never puts the plot in the back seat. Too often that happens to a show of this type, making it devolve into tedious melodrama that starts to feel like a soap opera.  I love Mad Men, but half-way into season two I started to feel like I was watching Melrose Place with brilliant set-design (thank god it redeemed itself in season three). Except for the occasional humorous moment (and sometimes there are many), the show is definitely a drama, but it's punctuated with enough twists and unexpected turns to satisfy the most rabid thriller fan.  It's plotting is written near-flawlessly.On another note, although the show looks nothing like a Wes Anderson film, its meticulous set-design and artfully cinematic look bring comparisons to my mind.  There is never a scene or shot that seems out of place or boring.  It also has moments of unforeseen action (think Bill Murray kicking the Pirates off his boat) that seem to come out of nowhere and lurch the characters and storyline forward rather than merely being cliché set-pieces which seem to be expected from a show essentially about criminals.In case you haven't noticed, I'd highly recommend the show. =)

  Terrific acting by Cranston and his side-kick! Great show,despite the parallel plot-lines with Weeds. However, Skylar is becoming irrelevant and boring.

  One of the Best Series every to be on TV. Every season from the 1st to the last kept getting better . Everyone I lent the dvd to got addicted watching it and could not stop talking about it . One of my all time Favorite shows on TV !
",5
"
  Fantastic! It's a very unique show, which I can't stop watching. Now I know what all the fuzz is all about.
",5
"
  The best shows are on pay cable, (Shameless, Boardwalk Empire, Homeland, Spartacus, etc.) but Breaking bad is top 5 on free TV!
",5
"
  A friend informed me that I had to check out breaking bad.  I have just finished watching season 1.  Breaking bad is the only series I have seen that could compare with The Wire.  Bryan Cranston is very believable as the main character.
",5
"
  this episode is a good one, Jesse tries to get a job since his partner don't want to continue making money off drugs. Walt and his wife goes to a old friend birthday party. Jesse meet his old friend after a bad job interview. They hook up to make crystal meth but it goes wrong when Jesse tries to make it perfect like his old partner, meanwhile Welt is offer a jod by his old only because the friend was told Walt was dying by his wife. Later on in the show Jesse & Walt are back at it.

  who could ask for more? Dramatic, humorous, great acting, great writing.  All the marks of good literature, irony, foreshadowing, and symbolism throughout.  Absolutely addicting....even if I am about 5 years behind

  If you like dark humor you will love this!  Once you start watching you can't stop. Great writers, Great actors.

"
  Great start to a great series. Entertaining and thought provoking.  What would you do?
",5
"
  I had already watched this show before purchasing, but I just had to buy it here because it was so much cheaper than in stores. I'm sure just about anyone would enjoy this show, and for the price, why not try it?
",5

  After the first five minutes, Breaking Bad had me hooked. In the hour that followed there was no way I was going to stop the video!

"
  Great Show.

"
  Awesome!

  This is the best series I've ever seen. The characters play their rolls to perfection. Every season gets better and better. Love this show!!

  I did not start watching AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" until after the second season had already aired. Having played catch-up and seen Seasons 1-3 in their entirety, I do not hesitate when I tell people that this is simply the best show on television right now, bar none.But most people spend these reviews talking about how great the series is, so I'll skip the warm-and-fuzzies and talk directly about the Season 1 DVD set that you are probably trying to decide whether to buy or not. Here's my recommendation: Buy it.First off, the box and cases. The box art is terrific, with the iconic Walt-White-in-tightie-whities stuck right onto the front. The box (which doesn't take up more than 3/4 an inch of shelf space, if even that) contains two plastic disc cases -- the first holds Episodes 1-6, and the second holds Episode 7 along with the Bonus Features. While I would avoid getting the box (which is something in between paper and cardboard) wet, the plastic cases hold up pretty well... I've dropped them several times and they've never so much as cracked on me.The picture quality is terrific. AMC is known for shooting their scripted television almost cinematically, so if you're a full-screen fanatic, get the heck out of here because widescreen is the only way to watch these. Blu-Ray babies: Sorry, the colors don't necessarily pop, but this isn't the kind of show that necessarily would benefit from that anyway.And finally, the bonus features. Audio commentaries are attached to both the pilot episode and Episode 6 (""Crazy Handful of Nothin'""), and feature showrunner Vince Gilligan, along with cast and occasionally crew. Most of the time, it can be pretty entertaining. The second disc has a Making Of feature for those of you who like that sort of thing; the real meat of the behind-the-scenes, though, comes from their 'Inside Breaking Bad' video compilation, in which each video is dedicated to a different aspect of the show (one video deals with Bryan Cranston shaving his head for the role, while another deals with the aforementioned tightie-whities). Also on the disc is a photo gallery and a segment of AMC's interview program called ""Shootout,"" when Cranston, Gilligan, and producer Mark Johnson appeared to promote the show. And last but certainly not least, the Bonus Features include screen tests of actors Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, and Dean Norris; really cool stuff if, again, you are into that sort of thing.Overall, a terrific box set for the show's first season, cut short by the writers' strike a few years ago. Season 2's boxset is even better, and I recommend that as soon as you buy this set, you hop on over and buy that one as well.I hope this review was informative, and I hope you enjoy the show as much as I did.The picture

  Funny, shocking, violent, gross, intriguing, with a protagonist who invokes a sympathetic character. Great acting and a totally different premise than anything I've seen before. I could not wait to watch the next episode.

  We heard a lot about this series and decided to give it a chance....Boy are we glad we did, fantastic story and actors!!

  This is the best series I have ever seen. Love it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes a lot of drama. Very fast and easy to follow.

  I found the first season a bit slow.  Had the feeling i wanted to fast forward some of the slow bits.  I have ordered season 2 and will make a final determination if i will continue with the rest of the series.  At the moment I am not as in love with this show as most people seem to be.

  Wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and know I see why. The first season went by way to fast.

  gave it to my boss as a christmas present and he and his family loved it, they are watching as a family together

  IT was very disappointing to see that there were no English subtitles in it. I was assuming that it would be there and did not bother to check. This should have been really available.

  Simply perfect. The build up is simply the best.... You are drawn into their lives beautifully. A must see series!

  Breaking Bad is probably my all time favorite series. Season 1 was especially good with the transformation of Walter White just beginning.

  My husband and I are absolutely hooked on this series!  We miissed the seasons on TV but were curious about the show, so we ordered the Season One DVD.  We were captivated from the start of the first show.  We have ordered the rest of the DVD's that are available and just started watching Season Three.This series has a mix of humor, drama and sadness that draws the viewer in.  The characters are very well developed and the story line is believable.  I've read that the network is going to kill the show at Season 5; that would be a real mistake.  I'm hoping that another network picks it up.  I am not ready to let go of Walter and Jesse and their strange, intertwined lives.  We look forward to the time we have to sit and devote our time to this fantastic one-of-a-kind show!
",5
"
  This is one series that never fails to draw in the viewer and amaze them.  We can't get enough of Breaking Bad.

  Enjoyed very much. Thanks for having this series available.

  The best written best acted show I have ever watched.  I was glued to the tv after the first scene.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad's dark comedic drama is well-written and features the great acting performances of Bryan Cranston, who deserves all the accolades from this smash hit!
",5
"
  Absolutely awesome! Edge of your seat entertainment!  Bryan Cranston is surprisingly perfect as a meth dealer. It's impressive that he can go from average dad to gangster with such ease.
",5
"
  I was very unhappy with this dvd.  There are NO English subtitles (however, you can get subtitles in French, Spanish, Portuguese).  My husband has a hearing loss and needs closed captions.  We had to crank up the volume to full blast and I still had to tell him some of the dialogue.  The series itself it is great.  Our viewing experience was not.  Amazon should clearly state that English subtitles are not available (Amazon customer service confirmed this, so it's not the case that we didn't know how to work the settings.)
",2
"
  Greatest series ever! I love Walter Whites and all of the cast of characters. This is a must watch show.
",5
"
  What can I say? This is simply the most riveting TV ever!!!! EVER!!!! It outstrips practically all Movies ever made. From beginning to end this is utter thrill! Adore the entire seasons gamut. So much that I bought this as a present for a friend.
",5
"
  Excellent writing, acting, great premise.
",5
"
  I never watched the series and read and heard so much about it. My room mate and i are addicted. We have watched 1, 2, 3 and are halfway thru season 4. Loved all. Amazon was so easy to use.
",5
"
  Totally hooked...
",5
"
  I will be ordering the other season as well.  Good series.  Maybe I'll ask for this for Christmas!!! !! !!
",5
"
  Makes me stop and think about the people we are in contact with daily. Who would have ever thought a chemistry teacher would make meth???
",5
"
  Addictive! A must see.  The story line is both disturbing and brilliant. My only hope is that Walt will become a bit tougher character. The cast is great and they each have their own interesting quirks.
",5
"
  You just fall for Mr. White. From the first episode it captures you and makes you want to call in sick so you can watch all 7 episodes in one day
",5
"
  BEST SHOW EVER!
",5
"
  Could not stop watching.

  I missed much of season 1 on AMC so I purchased the season on DVD.  The early shows are just as incredible as the remainder I had already seen from seasons 1 and 2.  There was nothing lost in going backwards in the series.  I think BB is an excellently produced, shot and scripted series - one of the best I've seen on TV in a long time.  Dark humor, shocking soap opera.  Looking forward to season 3!
",5
"
  We never watched this series while it was running, but heard so much about how good it was that we had to check it out.  Hooked!

  excellent
",5

  I loved this show watched the whole 5 seasons when AMC had their marathon. It deserved every award it ever got
",5
"
  I can't believe I waited this long to start watching this show. It's awesome. I'll be buying every season for sure.
",5
"
  my first order was successful but when i tried to order the  4th and 5th season of breaking bad it never shiped then when i tried to track it tonight it don't even say i ordered it but it took my money

  I love this show a must own at a great price thanks .5 Star rating from me.

  Great storyline and superb acting.
",5

  Everyone about the series is top notch.  great acting, writing and filming.  After the first episode, we were addicted and wanted to keep watching more.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is quite possibly the best show ever made for TV.  Watching on Amazon Instant video was a nice experience as well.
",5
"
  Forgot how much I loved the first season and watching it with other people who are only watching for the first time makes it hold up extremely well on re-watch.

  It is an excellent product, I received it very fast, in great conditions and I am very satisfied with purchase.

  What happens when a straight as arrow High School chemistry teacher finds out he has terminal lung cancer, a son with cerebral palsy and his wife is pregnant?! He partners in a meth lab using his considerable chemistry skills and gets into murder as well! This raw and gripping drama has plenty of dark / sardonic humor and is simply a treasure with great characters and very well acted. Only seven episodes is my only complaint about Season One.
",5
"
  Incredible show. Genius writing the most brilliant acting you will ever see. Intense, heart pounding, on the edge of your seat.

  everyone was telling me that if I can get through season 1, I would love the rest. Well I thought season 1 was excellent

  Great show. Gritty.
",5
"
  I love this series.  Its my favorite show of all time.  By far.Well worth it.  Cant wait for Season 5.
",5
"
  What looked like an intriguing series was barley understandable to the hearing impaired like me.  No English subtitles as I expected. Also, I wish movie directors would stop using so much whispered dialogue which comes across as practically inaudible.

"
  This was a wonderful play upon the mouse that roared. The main character changed from the meek to the bad ass creator of a whole new business to earn a large some of money. The cast of characters in the show are great, waiting for number three to come out.
",5
"
  Cool!
",5
"
  Slow in the beginning but lived up to the hype.

"
  BREAKING BAD IS FABULOUS! UNLIKE ANY OTHER SHOW OUT THERE, i CAN NOT SEEM TO GET ENOUGH OF THIS SHOW.
",5
"
  I heard about this show for years and never watched it. I recently purchased season 1 for my kindle, and I am now hooked. I finished the first season and have just downloaded season2. Very addictive
",5
"
  I avoided this show at first because of all the self-impressed promotions - ""Best show on television"" etc. I glimpsed yhe commercials and it just looked like some guy in prison having a hard time. Yawn. Then I noticed it on streaming Netflix and decided to see what all the hype was about. WOW!!! I was hooked in the opening 60 seconds. Great writing, performances, direction! Dark humor - my favorite. 3-dimensionl characters. This is the best TV series I have seen since....maybe ever. SEE IT!!!!!
",5
"
  Once you start watching this series you will find it difficult not to binge watch and stay up later than your normal bed time.
",5
"
  After all the noise about the ending of this program my wife and I decided to take a look, Amazon does not offer it in free Prime, not this one anyway so we 're taking a look. I figure a review is pointless because the majority loved the show......
",4
"
  Couldn't stop watching it or thinking about it....craziness.  I have to watch more.  Can't wait for the next episode.  YEAH
",5
"
  This show truly is one of the best shows in ever!  I'll always go back and watch all the episodes. If only you could give more stars!
",5
"
  I had missed this episode when the show first aired. This episode cleared up a bunch of my questions I had.
",5
"
  It takes awhile to get into the story but the last few episodes are enticing and make the story work.
",4
"
  Incedible
",5
"
  I did not think I would like this show after reading what it was about.  But I was so wrong!  This show has some great characters and some crazy plots!
",5
"
  This series was a great background for the seasons that followed. The plot was developed well. Those who played the characters did an excellent job.
",5
"
  a friend raved about this show so I thought I'd see what it was all about. have watched 5 episodes. so far so good. not for every one, but for those of us who like things a little off beat it works
",5
"
  Wonderful show
",5
"
  I am hooked....a slow descent is coming...well done! There is a bit Walter in everyone of us. Season 2 here we come.
",5
"
  I enjoyed this first introduction very much! It leaves you wanting more..i wish it was longer..Who can blame him? You Go Walt..
",5

  excellent tv
",5

  A very pleasing and intelligent program. I watched the first season in two days and wanted more.I will be purchasing the second and third seasons soon.

"
  Loved the first season and we are watching the second. Funny, yet poignantThe actors are all great. We love it
",5
"
  An introduction to a teacher's personal fight against cancer and an insight into the world of helping an addiction.  Funny but dead serious!
",5
"
  I have heard a lot about this show but have never watched it.  Watched the entire season 1 yesterday.  It is captivating.

  Great show . Can't wait to see rest of seasons . Acting is brilliant. Hated pulling for the drug dealer , but couldn't help myself.
",5
"
  Hard to stop watching!
",5

  It's amazing, I got hooked and watched through season 5.  Amazing. Keep in mind the first season is short, only around 7 episodes.  might be cheaper to just buy the on demand version.
",5
"
  Who doesn't give Breaking Bad 5 stars?
",5
"
  Came on time; packaged well.  Ordered it because friends suggested it.  Not sure yet.  Only watched the first 2 episodes.  Reminded me of Falling Down with Michael Douglas and I HATED that movie.  Time will tell ...
",4
"
  loved the whole show, the best show on AMC..the actors and crew did the best job.I would watch it over and over...thanks AMC...
",5
"
  Got hooked on this show in the first season. Very entertaining and great acting and plot twists.
",5
"
  watched every episode, we couldn't get enough of it.  Some nights we watched 3 or 4 in a row! Good show.
",5
"
  I am at this point undecided as to whether I really enjoy watching Breaking Bad.  After viewing the first two episodes, I am curious as to what happens in the story line, I am also a little disturbed about the subject matter.  Seems so immoral.
",4
"
  I've heard a lot about this series and the first season definitely lived up to all the hype. I'm looking forward to the rest

  As always Breaking Bad met all our expectations. Just as good as all other seasons-if not better,where it starts out with you on the edge of your seat-EXCELLENT !!

  Best series ever on TV.

  I can hardly wait to get to the second season.  The writing is adult and the viewer is treated as an adult.  Many. Surprises.  Love it.

  Breaking Bad is great entertainment in character study.  The actors play their roles to the letter and the viewer can feel their frustrations and pain by the way they play out these roles.  The series is very well done.

  Its a pretty good tv show. If you haven't given it a chance, you should! Its pretty awesome. The price is also fair.

  Never watched when it was out. So glad you have it available. Can't wait to purchase the second.! The characters are intense.

  I jumped on the Breaking Bad bandwagon a little late, but so glad I did.  One of the best series EVER!

  Just started watching the series last week.... Can't stop!  I'm getting involved in there lives!  I have to limit myself to 2 episodes per night......

  very addictive, love the writing!, wish this did not have a last season, i would highly recommend this to adults

  Awesome, great character development, great writing. Love to see parts of ABQ, however I think the show could have shown more love for ABQ.

  Great 1st season. Didn't catch when it originally ran. Hard not to binge!

  Breaking Bad is the best show ever! I have seen all seasons now and love every single one of them.

  Outstanding series.  Just couldn't figure out the 4th season until I got the first.  It came before schedule, in very good shape.  All in all a a very good seller.

  Bought this for a Christmas gift for my father in law who is a huge fan of the series. Although it's not that time yet, I'm sure there will be no problem with it as I've ordered many dvd's before and were satsified!!

  At times this is actually hard to watch, yet despite the violence, I am unable to walk away because I want to see what happens next.

  Came in good condition.  Watched it right away with my family.  (Didn't really know what it was about, and it really is NOT for family viewing.  Lesson learned.

  Now we're hooked on the series!

"
  This is an awesome edition of Breaking Bad and it has alot of scenes that you don't see on Net Flix.

  Each episode is very entertaining. The writers are very talented. I like the stories as they are different from any other TV show I have watched. So I consider B-B original and fresh.

  Violent but very well done.Great writing

"
  Started the series from the beginning on the recommendation of my daughter. At first it was intriguing. Now, in the fifth season, we just want to get it over with. We don't find we actually like any of the characters. The sleazy lawyer seems to be the nicest guy in the lot. The plot seems always to be what terrible thing will happen next.

"
  I found it a little confusing at the beginning but stay with it - it's great, you won't be sorry. It's intriguing and the acting is amazing.

  Humm, no wonder it got so many awards. Great story, great actors. I wanna watch the rest of the seasons!

  How disappointing to pay for one of the greatest shows ever put on TV and find that Amazon - with all the stuff they sell and distribute here - has decided to CENSOR this show.They've edited out language they deem ... I don't know ... ""inappropriate"" for a show about METH DEALERS???And they've decided this show also shouldn't have any nudity, so they've PIXELATED breasts. It's juvenile, it's insulting, and IT IS NOT BREAKING BAD - but some Sunday school teacher's lame redaction of Breaking Bad.DO NOT BUY THIS. Buy the disks, and buy them somewhere else. Anywhere else.(Oh, and Netflix has the real Breaking Bad. And it streams better with fewer ""loading"" interruptions - in fact, none - whereas Amazon was constantly stopping randomly and making us wait while the ""loaded"" AND reduced the quality. By the time we arrived at 42 minutes into Episode One - at 1 a.m. on a weeknight - they had degraded the quality to the point that it looked - no exaggeration - worse than what I could shoot on my phone's video recorder.)A total rip off.

  not sure why everyone likes this show so much.  I have watched all but the final season --  Jessie is my favorite character.  He grows and deals with so much.  Walt -- I can't decide if he is bad or good but leaning towards bad.

  All the season's are excellent!

"
  Unpredictable and totally exciting !

  LOVE LOVE LOVE

  So far I have just seen the first three episodes and I can't wait to see the rest of the season.

  Great show. Great acting. Great story lines. One of the best shows ever yo be seen on TV. AMC got it right.
",5
"
  Very addicting show.
",5
"
  The DVD was great and love the series its a shame the other 3seasons didn't work and had to be sent back
",5
"
  not compelling story line - acting is good but just not interesting.  Will give it a few more episodes to develop a captivating story and journey that we want to follow.  ""Ho-humm' after the first episode.

"
  this is an awesome movie! its a little gory at first and not for audiences with a weak stomach, however it soon gets better!Enjoy!
",5
"
  my title  tells it all: how great and unusual is this series. The acting is excellent  and the main character's metamorphosis is wonderfully done!
",5
"
  love it, so addicting - look forward to the next seasons!would definitely recommend to others, very unexpected and fun to watch
",5
"
  I can't say it any plainer than this: Breaking Bad is the best television ever and Season One (even though it is short) is essential!!
",5
"
  Amazing-dark, yet funny.Brilliant writing.Superb actingA terrific blend of drama and comedy that energizes all of the senses
",5

  Everything that I was hoping for.

  Super good love the series

  Breaking Bad all seasons were awesome I hated to see the show end but I guess it had to end.
",5

  Riveting!
",5
"
  Awesome series I watch it while I work out ....makes 45 mins fly right by !
",5

  Season one of breaking bad got me hooked.  It took one month of my life as I couldn't stop watching each episode.
",5
"
  The Best!
",5
"
  This show is amazing to say the least, very easy to follow yet extremely in depth with everything. Great experience.
",5
"
  One of the best drama/comedy's in a long time. I love the twists and turns, but mostly the surprises. Great job AMC.
",4
"
  Loved the entire series.  The evolution of Walter White from Mr. Chips to Scarfaceis exciting and mesmerizing to watch.
",4
"
  Excellent. The world around these characters is set up perfectly. They outrageous premise seems perfectly reasonable by the end of the first hour. Every bit as good as they say
",5
"
  Does this show improve after season one? I've watched the first five episodes and I'm finding this show just okay. I also think the writing on this show ranks well below the quality of The Shield and 24. I'm also wondering why Bryan Cranston won an Emmy for this season. He coughs a lot but not much else is there as far as acting goes.
",3
"
  LOVED IT!
",5
"
  The acting, writing and and scenes were excellent. I wasn't going to watch it (and didn't until season 2, but I finally did and could quit.
",5
"
  The characters are lovable, the plot interesting, and there is suspense.  Can't wait for Season 2!
",5
"
  Was having trouble with Netflix so I bought this episode.  The problem was the Sony Blu-Ray player configured for both wired and WiFi.  It defaulted to WiFi when both were present.  WiFi congestion (in a multi-dwelling building) caused lots of buffering.
",3
"
  Just for the info, the bluray is region 1 not all region.i was able to watch it on my american PS3 though :)
",5
"
  I need to purchase some more episodes for sure! :) It has a great story plot that and very good actors as well.

  perfect entertainment!!  Really enjoyed it  I am ordering season 2 and 3 today.  Want to see it all in order

  loved it!  how did i miss watching this series?  walter white is my new favorite.  looking forward to season 3.

  I purchased the entire series - (5), for my son for Christmas last year - it was nice because I pre-ordered season 5 and he received it later in the year when it was released - a belated Christmas gift, he was very happy!!!

  Just a beginner but hooked  looking forward to all the seasons all the characters are great  ta ta ta tat

  It is one of the best shows I've ever seen wish it hadn't ended I would still be watching it

  Couldn't stop watching!!!!!

  This in one series you have to watch from episode 1. It's epic! Pa attention to the details of each episode.

  I'm hooked!

  Great characters and storyline.  This is the best tv show ever, I can't believe i didnt catch on to this sooner!
",5
"
  We are absolulety loving this show, I can't wait to come home and watch it every evening.  This is the way to do it....buy the season and watch in a week.
",5
"
  Best series I ever watched.  Never thought I would  cheer for a drug dealer.  Characters are complex lots of subplots too.
",5
"
  i would tell any one interested in the show that they should watch the first season. they will want to see what happens next!!!!
",5
"
  The series is spectacular, best drama I've ever watched. There is a small issue though, the boobies are censored and the swear words are replaced with utter silence, not even a bleep. 4 out of 5 because of the censoring (which in fact was not amazons fault, they receive the censored versions from AMC) otherwise, the show is spectacular! I think getting it on DVD is a better idea though, if you hate the censoring.
",4
"
  Good price.  We enjoy Breaking Bad and having all the seasons on DVD allows us to watch it when we want to.
",5
"
  I bought the first and second season of these as a gift for my fiance and he loves them. He cant stop watching them. Definitely addictive and interesting. A great gift for any adult.
",5
"
  What a great show.  This will make you laugh and gives you a real punch in the gut feeling for real life.
",5
"
  its surprising, it's a  good story, i  will want to watch some more.  i'm sorry it's ending deserves five stars
",5
"
  Awesome!!

  Everything good about the packaging and the quality of the image and wow the sound is amazing with the explosions

  The show is highly addictive.

  Its awesome. Can't go wrong with this product. It's a great show. I will order more of this product in rhe near future.
",5
"
  Best show ever!
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is seriously good. I cannot stop watching it and I'm desperate for more.This would be a grim, grim show if it weren't for the humor in the writing and complexities in the characters. The humor often has an element of realism: even in the worst situations, life can be quirky and ironic. Though there are some cartoonish supporting roles, there's also subtly and humanity infused in most of the recurring characters. And yet, it's all a little exaggerated, making it all the more compelling a story.
",5
"
  Fabulous! Loved The first season and just bought the second, third and fourth. I highly recommend it's worth the small price.
",5
"
  Awesome series.  Anyone ordering the series start with season one before you proceed to the next series.. Such a good good show, don't hesitate to watch this and the rest of the series..
",5
"
  We were hooked from the minute we started watching.  We watched the whole first season in one day!! We couldnt pull ourselves away from the kindle
",5
"
  Awesome story.  Great acting.
",5
"
  Well written and hilarious. Grabs you into the story and wont let go. Very addictive.  Can't wait for season two.
",5
"
  Cranston's fantastic.  This is a riveting, raw account of a man on a dangerous mission... absurd enough to be true. Hugely entertaining... can't wait for the second season.
",5
"
  This was purchased for my son.This is one of his favorite shows and mine too.we both were very pleased too.
",5
"
  An amazing season opening.
",5
"
  Can't stop watching.  We're staying up way past bedtime!  So many twists and turns.  Top notch performances by all characters!

  Love it

  Hands down the best story ever told on television

  Very entertaining show!  Sad to see the effects of the world of Meth.  I would definitely recommend this show to friends!

  Fantastic,this tv series is great I love it very much.I recomended to everyone who likes tv series.Service very fast. Ok

  awesome...addictive
",5

  Now I understand all the hype.

  I started watching this because my husband wanted to. To me, it seems similar to the show Weeds, which I love. This one makes me laugh and I want to see more.
",4
"
  Very good
",5
"
  Realistic!

"
  Love this show.  The show is dark at times and at times hilarious.  I got addicted on the first episode and have been hooked since.
",5
"
  Great show! Very addicting. Watched the entire season in two days. Planning on buying the rest of the seasons very soon.
",5
"
  Nothing further to add... one of the best shows ever on TV.
",5
"
  i can not get enough of breaking bad, waiting for the season 5 release and delivery from amazon; call me an addict!
",5
"
  Like watching a train wreck in slow motion
",4
"
  Yes, eye candy when willing to zone out. But, essentially, depressing. The characters evoke no sympathy--except, perhaps Walt, because they are totally self absorbed and mindless. His family is a particular disaster--selfish, obnoxious, and short sighted. I tried watching the series in the early evening so I don't carry these nightmarish situations and characters to bed. Really, self indulgent without grace, learning or redemption., Truly a saddening depiction the second decade of the 21 St. Century. Glad I'll miss most of the rest...RIP.
",3
"
  Well I have just watched episode 1,so hard to say . I do find it weird that there is still a fee,for that season. Did see it free on other website.
",4
"
  This is one of the first series that has kept me waiting for next week in years. I was captivated by the understated tension Bryan is able to show so realistically. Good people are forced underground by devastating illness and of course medical expenses in this country, all the time. This forces you to look at it. Illegal substance production/abuse is never a black or white issue at the core, even though it's never the ""right"" choice, this shows us what happens when it seems like the ""only"" choice.Keep up the good work!!
",5
"
  My Husband just loves it! and we bought all the seasons and are currently waiting on the fifth season! Cool!
",5
"
  So addicting and I can't wait to watch the rest of the seasons!
",5
"
  Great!
",5
"
  This is the steak. amc has come out with some great shows, and now when I watch other shows I see how bad they are.
",5
"
  super!
",5
"
  I Heard about this at work.  Really good series, I like watching more than 1 show at a time.  Had to buy the rest of the series!
",5
"
  The best tv series ever!!!
",5
"
  Best show on TV.
",5
"
  I got hooked after watching one episode. I feel the acting, camera work and scripts are currently the best on television.
",5
"
  I had heard about breaking bad from friends for years, but in my quest to not spend so much time watching TV I resisted for years. I finally broke down and bought the first 2 seasons on blu ray and I can't stop watching them! Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor and I can't wait to catch up on all the seasons (up to season 3 already and I still can't stop watching!!)

  Excellent

  Such a smart, grotesque show!

  Ass kicking for beginning to end!  A must see!  Again and again!  I highly recomend, unless you are a square...
",5
"
  So far so good!  Only three episodes in but loving it.
",5
"
  I am so glad that I switched from DVD to Blu Ray- the extra features and better quality are worth it!
",5
"
  It's just a synopsis of the show. It tells you about who these characters are. It was nice to see the writer of the show.
",3
"
  I love it!  Worth every penny.
",5
"
  I enjoyed it from the start.  The plot is full of surprises, and I see the growth and direction of the characters.  Very engrossing movie.
",4
"
  Everybody told me I had to watch so I did... Didn't love it... Loved Walter but couldnt stand his whiny ass stupid partner or his wife.
",2
"
  Love !!!!! I look forward to watching everyday.
",5
"
  Amazing!
",5
"
  I love this show, now entering its third season on AMC.  I can't wait for the second season to come out to start my Breaking Bad library.
",5
"
  Can't help it, know I shouldn't- but I still love this series.  Such a strange premise - high school chemistry teacher teams up with former (awful) student to make and sell meth, yet, it works.  My husband and I found ourselves wondering with each episode what could possibly happen next.
",5
"
  Excellent show!!!!  Too bad the writer's strike cut the season short.  Will definitely be getting Season 2.
",5
"
  Fantastic!
",5
"
  I usually don't watch any TV series that air, but after someone mentioned this show was about a high school chemistry teacher making meth I couldn't resist.  This show is very unique in that the plot is highly unpredictable because of the characters.  This is constant throughout each episode and keeps you wanting more.  I plan on buying all the seasons.
",5
"
  This product came to me in a timely manner, and worked very well. It played perfectly, and I really enjoy this product.
",5
"
  one of the few television programs of recent times that I like, and I like it a lot.  having it on dvd to watch it at my pace is the way i like it, and without commercials
",5
"
  Great show but disappointed that it's only 7 episodes long.Also disappointed that Season 2 doesn't have Spanish subtitles,go figure....
",5
"
  Re: to those that whinge about the price for 7 episodes, what do these people want, 22 episodes of Cr*p, or 7 of quality?This is amongst the finest TV that I've seen.I've got the Blu-ray version, which is grainy compared to all the other Blu-ray and HDDVDs that I own, but in spite of that, I still gave it 5 stars.  Before anyone buys the Blu-ray version, I would advise them to compare the picture quality for the DVD and Blu-ray versions, and then decide which to buy.The Blu-ray disc case is marked as suitable for regions ABC, but is in fact the discs are region A.
",5
"
  Amazing!
",5
"
  Quirky like Albuquerque.
",5
"
  Love the series. Enjoy being able to watch when I want without commercials.
",5
"
  Love this show!
",5
"
  But I do.  I just started watching it and it was engaging from the pilot episode.  It is really funny.
",4
"
  i love this show could watch over and over again!!! And i plan on doing just that.!! love it love it!!
",5
"
  Enjoy it so far but I've not yet finished the series.  Anxious for the next seson season good or bad
",4
"
  We very much enjoy the Breaking Bad show.  I believe that virtually everyone will enjoy it and be thoroughly hooked after watching only the first 1 or 2 episodes.  Both the writing and acting are exceptional.  It's very sad that the show is ending after the current season.
",5
"
  Just WOW!
",5
"
  What I particularly like about this show is how Walt's applied knowledge of chemistry gives him the upper hand in several confrontations, and how he is also able to teach his former student the real ramifcations of all the chemistry curriculum he never bothered to learn in Walt's class.
",5
"
  A friend recommended this series to me so I decided to buy it.  Just got into to it but I know I'll like it
",4
"
  This isn't an actual episode of the show, just a long trailer with but it helped me understand what the show was about since I heard a lot about it but hadn't actually seen any of it.  Good intro.
",3
"
  Good show
",5
"
  Now I finally know what all the fuss was about, it took a couple episodes to get involved for me, but once I did, we couldn't wait to watch the next episodes.
",5
"
  Product is great quality, was as described and due to this even bought another item. Great sturdy brand no regrets.
",5
"
  This set was cheap and arrived prompt in professional packaging.  Very excited to view all of the special features!  Can't wait for the final 8 episodes.
",5
"
  The navigation through the menu is a little slow and cumbersome, but the theme stays consistent through the other series blu-ray discs.
",5
"
  This is an intense, edge of your seat show. It has left me breathless on more than one occasion. I can't wait for the finish.
",5
"
  Had I seen the beginning, I'm not sure I would have watched the series as it is rough to watch. However, I stared during Season 3, bought Season 2 so wanted to catch up from beginning. Now waiting for 3 to see all episodes. It is good. I learned about the drug world which was my reason to watch in the first place. Money is the reason for everything for the makers and dealers. Not a world I would want to live in but needed to know about.
",4
"
  It's fun
",4
"
  It is dark, it is fascinating it leaves me wanting more. I can't wait for the next show!
",5
"
  Of course the show is great - but everything was in good condition when I received it so that's why it gets 5 stars
",5
"
  This is by far one of the best shows I have ever watched. The acting is incredible.  Can't wait for season 2.
",5
"
  This is a gripping series.  It makes you think about what Walt is doing... is it excusable?  Understandable? You really feel for him and at the same time are appalled at what he is doing.  I watched the first season in one sitting - it's like a book you can't put down.  If you like good drama, you will like this show.
",5
"
  This program examines the path that can lead a respectable man to begin, and continue, to raltionzlise behavior that he would generally see as reprehensible.  It also hoist the self righteous on the horns of their own weakness.  I recommend it.An exciting examination of good vs. evil vs. good.  The story line stays together very well, the characters are believable....overall a good tale told well.
",4
"
  We just bought this for my dad for fathers day and he has already finished season one along with season 2.Quick shipping. Perfect condition. Exactly what we ordered. No surprises.
",5
"
  Can't stop watching. Original, well written and superbly acted. I'll be getting the next season without a doubt. Watch it.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is a series I was kind of hesitant about. It's odd story had kept me from watching it but I found it cheap on Amazon so I went for it. Best decision I've made in some time. Great acting, unique story, great character development. Must have for any TV fanatic.
",5
"
  Well written Series -- Too Spendy -- Watched elsewhere -- Not Gadget-Guy recommended -- Why is this here for my review?
",2
"
  Great series!!!
",4
"
  I don't hate the series, but I am very upset that the advertising that starts the disc has spoilers. The disc advertises that season three is starting soon on TV and gives sound bites from season two. One of the quotes seems to give a major plot point away.
",1
"
  When you get through Season 1, you won't be able to wait for Season 2. So get both now. Awesome. Insane.
",5
"
  Sopranos.The Wire.Breaking Bad.Unequivocally one of the best shows EVER on television.  Rivals that of anything on HBO or any other network.  You would be a fool not to watch this show.
",5
"
  I particular the bleak, in-your-face approach to writing. The writers didn't skip or gloss over any of the true-to-life details that make Breaking Bad such a gripping story.
",5
"
  Interesting but boring at times when the main character does not progress at all!
",4
"
  breaking bad came recommended to me from a friend that has prime amazon. I have only watch the pilot  so far and would recommended.
",4
"
  The show was excellent, HOWEVER, when i went to purchase Season Two, the price was 5 higher than the Season One.  I found that most disturbing.It lures you in because the first season was so inexpesive.  Then once you are hooked in the price goes way up.  I do not think that is fair at all.  You should disclose that at some point before you purchase Season One.I am  not happy,and did not buy it.
",5
"
  I've only watched this one so don't know how it develops yet.
",4
"
  I didn't know what to expect.  Very good. It started out sad then odd then funny.  I think it's a drama/comedy
",5
"
  at least for me it isn'ti was sorry that season one was cut short by the writers. THIS is what TV should be like. i loved it and am a devoted fan now.Can't wait for season three on Blu Ray
",5
"
  You can expect the unexpected, the acting and writing are top notch, and I love seeing Albuquerque and the southwest!
",5

  Bought this as a gift for someone and they still never watched it. What a waste of money.Anyway i loved Breaking Bad. i've watched the whole series. 10/10

  Great price for a great show! Came fast and well packaged

  The Breaking Bad series does not have ENGLISH subtitles. It is very had to believe that this is the case when there are hearing impaired people who rely on this to watch something.  There are subtitles in foreign languages, but NOT ENGLISH.  The DVD's have been sent back.  Very very disappointed!

"
  extremely well written - has a good story and definitely keeps you glued to the TV

"
  It's pretty wacky stuff, but the writing and active are really good.  It shows why cable TV really makes it.
",5
"
  Fantastic, excellent acting, great writing. Have not been hooked on a series in a long timeAlready bought season two and threeWell worth investment
",5
"
  I really wasn't expecting to like this show. The acting was so outstanding that the story captured me. I still have a hard time enjoying a series about a science teacher who burns meth with his student. I feel uncomfortable after watching it.  They've certainly given him a lot of reasons to do this. One big reason not to: it will hurt, even kill, other people.
",3
"
  This show is amazing. I was turned on by my brother to this show and it's everything he hyped it up to be. Just start watching ;)
",5
"
  interesting storyline
",5
"
  I'm looking for season 2 on my computer
",4
"
  I am trying to hang in there because so many people say it is so great but it is rather depressing through season one.
",3
"
  I finally bought this to catch up with the series everyone raves about b/c it was on sale. The writing is good, as well as the characters and the acting; however, I still don't buy how Walter went so quickly from milquetoast to arch criminal. The cinematography is xlnt as well.And, it's basically fascinated with totally degraded human beings, like the drug addict who pukes to death in her sleep, a meme which by now is a cliche. When will filmmakers tire of these anti-heroes? What would be really ""edgy"" would be if someone renounced criminality and found meaning in a conventional life.
",3
"
  Series gets tiring after awhile
",3
"
  Just started watching, so don't have much to say yet.  The show seems pretty good and am happy they are on Prime
",4
"
  This product arrived on time and came in great condition. The DVDs were where they were supposed to be and the discs work great.
",5
"
  I bought Season One of this show on Amazon Instant Video because it had been noted as a funny show and had Bryan Cranston as the main character.  I am not a huge television fan but was looking for some good quality shows to see.  I watched the first few episodes, and although they were mildly funny, I have yet to finish the series.  It just didn't do it for me.  The plot was rather lame, the acting was mediocre.....I just didn't find the show to be my cup of tea.  I will probably watch the rest of the season eventually, but only if I can't find anything better to do.
",3
"
  OK - I'm an engineer/science guy so like this type with the techy stuff that is not just based on computers and software.  I'm an old Slide Rule guy.  Only into the 3rd chapter - don't yet see how they can make it last so many seasons.

  Couldn't make it through the season

  I absolutely love Breaking Bad such a well produced show. The CD's were brand new and very very good quality.

  We kept waiting for a few characters who might be appealing and they never showed up.  If you enjoy watching unattractive, annoying, people do awful things, this is for you.  I wish I had taken a pass.

  I bought all seasons of Breaking Bad -- I am a very serious addict of this show.  It is without any doubt the best thing I've ever seen on TV!  I'm a senior citizen and need captions -- IN ENGLISH!  I returned all the DVD because I could not enjoy without the captions.  Thankfully they have Spanish, French and Portuguese for those who understand these languages.  Nice touch.  But English does not work.  I should have read the 1 star reviews first and not wasted my time.I would love to have this series as part of my collection -- so much so that I have tried to locate an address for Sony to see if they ever release them with captions in English.  No luck.  If Sony fixes this problem I would love to reorder.

  Wonder what would make a high-school chemistry teacher start cooking meth? This pilot episode of Breaking Bad does an amazing job of connecting you with the life of the man who makes this unthinkable decision. Not only is the story compelling, but the characters are incredibly well played and the pace of the action makes it hard to turn away. This is an excellent show! I cannot wait to see the next episode.

  Breaking Bad is a dark, suspenseful drama that sucks you in and won't let go.  Very well written and acted, it is a peek into a gritty underworld most of us never see.

  all very realistic characters, sets, etc.  It is satisfying to see an underdog doing what an underdog sometimes must do

  Dark humor at times.  Different than most dramas.  Good acting.  Storyline a bit slow and too few episodes for a season.  Makes you have to buy multiple seasons.  A bit high on pricing for Prime Members

  It's funny to hear all the people who are upset with this being a ""censored"" version.  I purposely bought the first season from Amazon for the edited version, unlike Netflix.  This has a TV-14 rating, and still only some of the F-words are bleaped out, not all.  And the sexual scenes are way to graphic to be TV-14.  Call me old fashion but I could do without alot of the ""details"" and the show would still be just as good.  Which by the way, I do enjoy the show, I'm just disappointed that only some things seemed to be censored.  I should have just saved my money and watched it on Netflix (since I already pay for it).  For that reason, I don't feel I got what I thought I was paying for (an edited version) and I give it a 2 star rating.

  The show is great. After waiting too long to open the package, we found that the second disk is missing, so we could only watch three episodes. It's too late for a return. Open your DVD right away to make sure all the disks are there.

  I bought the whole series as a gift and he LOVED them- and then proceeded to get my husband hooked on the series too!

  I like the psychologically-complicated characters in this series.  Morality is hardly ever black and white; and this show seems to explore that.

  I ordered this for my boyfriend because it was so highly rated and it sounded like something he would enjoy.  He didn't.  I (we) didn't realize it was so quirky, sort of a dark humor.  Not for us.
",2
"
  I was not a fan when it first started, but ever since I started streaming it on Netflix I could not stop watching it and it has hooked me ever since.  This was truly an amazing way to start things off with some brilliant performances by the two lead actors.  I have always been a fan of Vince Gilligan's work on the X-files too so this was like watching more of that.  Can't wait for the 5th season finale!

  Flash was a bad technology when it was being supported. It's even worse now, on top of being obsolete. It doesn't work correctly (when it works at all), it crashes, the audio often gets out of sync (especially if you try to rewind or fast forward), it runs all of my processors so hard that the fans come on and ruin the viewing experience. It's just terrible in every way. I am running the latest version of Adobe's flash player (all of my software is always up to date).The show is really good. I'd give it 4 stars (and that's a lot considering the general quality of television these days) if watching it weren't ruined by Flash player. I'll be watching the rest of the series on netflix.

  this is demoralizing.why would anyone show the world how to make meth?no matter what you think about drugs,meth is poison and this isn't even interesting TV.Bryan Cranston is stiff,the dialogue doesn't flow.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the storyline is ok,nothing special,but not extremely boring either.I don't get the fascination with this.it's just low IMO.should have been scraped or made into a c movie.

  Even though the package says there is closed captioning, there is not. I believe this is a manufacturing defect.  I've written to Sony to David Bishop, President, Worldwide SonyPictures Home Entertainment, and though he forwarded my request to his consumer affairs department, they have just given me the runaround and there has been no action.  This was a gift for my father who is hard of hearing and needs the closed captioning to be able to follow the story. I said to Mr. Bishop:  I purchased all four seasons of  the AMC series ""Breaking Bad"" on DVD for my father who is elderly and hard of hearing.  I chose these DVDs because they included the ""CC"" code on the package which convinced me they had closed captioning encoding on the disk.  This is important to me for my father, but you probably know that 48M people in the US (up to 15% of your customers) are deaf or have some degree of hearing loss. Providing accessibility extends your audience reach in the deaf community, as well as helps you meet legal requirements.  As the population ages, the number of people relying on closed captioning will surely rise.Closed captioning has been provided on a voluntary basis by many movie producers, studios, and distributors for movie videos and DVDs produced for sale or rent.  Though it is voluntary, having the symbol of ""CC"" on the packaging would seem to me to be a promise that the disks were, indeed, encoded with closed captioning.  Sadly, I tried to display this on several devices and on my PC using Windows Media Player as well as HP's TouchSmart DVD player.  It does not display on any of our three DVD players.  I do not believe the closed captioning tracks exist.There are subtitles, but only in French and Spanish .  English subtitles could have helped my Father since he is not totally deaf, but you do not have English subtitles on any of them.I paid more than $60 for all four seasons.  I’ve disappointed my father who was looking forward to them.  So, I am appealing to you to explain why you have not included the Closed Captioning on these DVDs.  Your company is a leader in the industry and even though you're not required to encode the Closed Captioning, putting it on the package is a promise that was not fulfilled.  Had I known, I would not have purchased them for him.I learned that you distinguished yourself for leading the industry in the initial launch of DVDs while at MGM and with you at the helm, MGM received numerous prestigious customer service awards.  I am only one customer, but I do feel I am speaking not only for myself, but for 48 million customers who also need your leadership.  I look forward to understanding this situation more and I hope for a solution from your customer service team right away.  (Dad isn't getting any younger)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is sad when Sony can take our money and not be responsive to a report of a defect. In my research, I've learned that many of Sony's DVDs seem to have this defect when it comes to closed captioning.  I would be very wary of purchasing any more DVDs from Sony.

  We finally got around to watching this series and got through the first three episodes (disc 1) but when we tried to watch episode 4 (2nd disc), the disc froze and skipped. We would have liked to get just that disc replaced, but, since we bought it at the end of March, we only had one month to return it.  I would have liked more opportunity to get satisfaction from this purchase, but there was no online option. Everything else we've ever purchased has been fine and it should be evident from our purchase history that we buy seasons at a time. It's not uncommon for it to take 4 or 5 months to complete a season, but when we're ready to watch a season, we only have limited time to watch and would have appreciated some options for relief.

  Perhaps so.  And to be fair, I've only watched Season One -- and that because almost all of my friends assured me that I'd love it.  Well, I didn't.  I found the lead actor/character both dull and annoying.  Ditto his family.  Ditto his sidekick.  Because of the tremendous buzz around the series, and because friends have assured me that it gets better as it goes along (particularly that the outside villains get more interesting), I have not given up completely on Breaking Bad.  But I'll not be buying the next installments; if I ever get streaming NetFlix set up (which probably won't happen quickly), I'll no doubt give Season Two a whirl.

  Everything has been thoroughly covered in all of the above reviews about this great drama series. I saw Breaking Bad on standard DVD and AMC, so I bought the BluRay. I was totally disapointed in the picture resolution. The grain is a constant distraction, especially of blue skies and dark scenes. To call this ""high def"" is just totally wrong and a unnecessary ripoff, since I'm sure they have the technical ability to produce a perfect picture such as Boardwalk Empire. Shame on you for taking my money under false pretenses.

  Seriously. Amazon finds it wholey acceptable to show meth production, murder and a wide swath of crime, but no swearing. The show is fine but for Amazon to make such a perverse decision for their viewers is beyond comprehension. Are they saying so long as you clean up the language the show is suitable for kids or are they saying adults shouldn't have to listen to foul language while they enjoy a jaunt into methland? Weird and idiotic reasoning.

  1)  walter white is and always has been a selfish unlikeable dick.  2)  the idea of this series is to ""make a man out of"" a quiet nerdy type of guy...by making him go postal and tap into all of his worst instincts and urges.  his character becomes a psychopath engulfed by anger and violence and craving money and power.  the show makes it seem like this makes him ""more of a man,"" more respected by others, and more virile to his wife.  I don't know what kind of sick twisted fantasy this represents...but anyone who thinks that this guy is a badass has a screw loose.  walter white is the epitome of toxic masculinity, and this show glorifies the hell out of it.  it is disturbing that people think this is a great show.

  I'm reviewing this disk set, not the program itself.How is it possible in the United States, in 2009, many years after the passage of the ADA that a company thinks it's right to release an American title without subtitles for the hard of hearing in English?  Shame on the company that produced this video. Don't buy these disks if you are hearing impaired English speaker, you won't be able to enjoy the program. This show aired form 2008-2013. There is no excuse for it not to have English subs.
",1
"
  Crime/drug dramas don't really appeal to me. In fact, I resisted watching this show for a long time and only reluctantly agreed to give it a try.  Then I got hooked.  My husband had to implement a rationing plan because otherwise I would have watched the entire disk straight through and then reached for the next one!The series draws you in by presenting a sympathetic protagonist faced with a terminal diagnosis. While we may disagree with Walter White's choices, we can nevertheless understand his motives and even root for him to succeed.  Unfortunately for Walt, making money from meth isn't as simple as cook and sell, nor is it completely safe.  The situations Walt finds himself in, the choices he makes, and the things he has to do make this season riveting.  The terrible decisions he has to make transform him from a passive, hen-pecked husband into an assertive and decisive man who does what he has to.  His lung cancer is killing him, but it paradoxically has also brought him to life.But the focus isn't just on Walt.  Walt's former student and young partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, balances Walt's academic brilliance with street smarts.  Under the slang, baggy clothes, and dissolute life is a decent human being I hoped would pull himself together.  Walt's brother-in-law, the DEA agent, adds spice to the mix when he learns there's a new meth cook in town and starts investigating.  Then there is Walt's family, from whom he hides his illicit activities.  My review wouldn't be complete without saying something about his wife, Skyler.  Several scenes in this season have cemented her in my mind as a controlling, self-focused woman who oversteps her bounds and disregards others to get what she wants.Even chemistry plays a role in the story.  Walt uses his knowledge on several occasions to deal with challenges.  James Bond had his gadgets.  Walt has chemistry.Scattered throughout the season are hints of backstories waiting to be told and questions yet to be answered.This is the most compelling television series I've watched in a long time!

  Albuquerque, New Mexico. Walter White is a former genius chemist who, for unclear reasons, dropped out of a high-paid salary in cutting-edge research and now works in a high school. He is married, has a disabled son and is expecting another baby, but is also overworked and underpaid, pulling shifts in a garage to make extra money. When he is diagnosed with advanced lung cancer, White realises he must take drastic action to make enough money for his family to survive when he is gone.So, Breaking Bad. The most lauded TV show since The Wire, a critical darling and a smash popular success. Is it really as good as it made out? Potentially, although as of this time of writing I'm only a few episodes into the third season.Unless you've been living under a rock (on Pluto), you've probably heard of the premise: underpaid government employee cooks meth with his drop-out ex-student to fund his own medical treatment and leave something behind for his family. It sounds goofy but Vince Gilligan's scripts and the powerful central performance by Bryan Cranston sell the idea completely. Things are helped by an array of talented supporting actors, from more established faces like Dean Norris and Anna Gunn to newcomer RJ Mitte, and a nice, firm grasp of tone. Gilligan and his co-writers create an offbeat-feeling world where they can switch from a dramatic, intense discussion of drug addiction to the black humour of what happens if you try to dissolve a human body with acid in a non-acid resistant bath (ignoring the fact that Myth Busters proved this wouldn't work, anyway). Breaking Bad has a heavy reputation for being about the collapse of the American family everyman into a selfish villain, but it also does goofy comedy quite well, without sabotaging the show's more serious side.It's also a quite remarkably beautifully-filmed show. It intercuts traditionally-shot scenes on film with digital scene-setting shots of the New Mexico countryside and, in HD, these look amazing. The cinematography and lighting of the show puts many films to shame and gives it a real sense of place.But at the core of the show in this first season is this idea that the capitalist ideal - the American Dream in the US - is a sham: you can work really hard, have great ideas, have a loving family and still end up with nothing, in debt up to your eyeballs and unable to provide for yourself, let alone anyone else. That isn't an excuse for White's subsequent headfirst dive into criminality, but it is a powerful motivation for a character driven by a remorseless sense of logic that wins out over morality or common sense. The show's unrelenting, unflinching exploration of that drive is highly compelling, if often uncomfortable to watch.The first season of Breaking Bad is superbly written, immaculately focused, intensely acted, beautifully shot and quite impressively clever. It is let down only by a too-abrupt finale (a consequence of two more episodes being cut by the studio during the 2008 Writer's Strike) and some thinly-developed side characters (the purpose of Hank's wife is what again?). So far, it's living up to the hype. I highly recommend the Blu-Ray edition as it shows up the cinematography so much better in HD.

  As I recall the definition of ""tragedy' is when one character flaw of the protagonist overwhelms all his positive qualities and leads to his destruction.If that is true then this is a magnificent tragedy of Shakespearean proportions on the same level as King Lear.  Think about the way Shakespeare progresses as the main protagonist's delusions are slowly stripped away leaving him with nothing.  Vince Gilligan does it even better here.If you would have told me five years ago that a TV series would ever equal The Wire I would have told you that were insane.  And I would have been wrong. Breaking Bad beats The Wire by an inch.  Even compared to Lonesome Dove, Breaking Bad is the highest point that television has ever reached.A masterpiece that will be discussed as long as there is such a thing as video.

  It's disappointing to pay money for a TV series only to find it has been re-edited inexplicably for distribution, presumably on Amazon.  (?)While I can live without the F-words and frontal nudity, it is exceedingly annoying to have paid for this without a single hint of this modification to the production as it was originally intended to be viewed.Plus...complete silences inserted over adult language?  Really?My Vote:  Do NOT spend your money.  Purchase the DVD, BluRay or get it through NetFlix.:-)

"
  WOW!  After watching this on AMC and hearing all sorts of language, I was very surprised to have the F-word bleeped out, especially after the main character just grabbed himself and said shine this!  There is also a scene where a women's breasts are pixeled out.  I'm 52 and feel cheated, I don't want my TV censored and for that I give it 1 star, I could not truly appreciate the show with parts of the dialogue bleeped out.  I seriously doubt that I'll be buying the other seasons via Amazon or if it's all VOD then I'll have to do DVD's or just not bother at all.Amazon should state somewhere that you are buying a censored version, if they had I would not have bothered.

  I first heard about this series when I learned that a restaurant in Albuqerque had become famous by being a site for the filiming of some of the scenes in this show. After The Sopranos, this is the best series I know. It is so good that I would often watch 2 or 3 episodes in a sitting.Below is a short summary of the basic plot. If you want to be completely surprised, stop reading here.Breaking Bad is the story of a high school chemistry teacher named Walter White who gets cancer. Due to the expensive medical treatments, he is having trouble making ends meet. So he decides to go into buisiness with one of his former students, Jessie Pinkman, selling crystal meth.He keeps this secret from his wife Skyler. To compound the problem, Skylers sister Marie is married to a DEA agent named Hank.Some have criticised this show for glamorizing the selling of illegal drugs. However what it really shows you is that once you become involved in this business that your life will change. Walter White starts meeting other seedy characters who want to do him harm. To cope with this he changes from a mild manneredschool teacher into a ruthless guy. There is no way to remain in a business like this and remain an ordinary person.Bryan Cranston does an amazing job of playing Walter White. He is also surrounded by a great supporting cast. This show is highly recommended.Spoiler Alert - do not read below if you do not want to read some hints regarding future seasons of Breaking Bad.It is very interesting to see the change in Walter White's wife, Skyler, over the various seasons. She starts out knowing nothing about his businessand ends up helping him to launder some of the dirty money by purchasing a new family business. What happens to Walter White in the end?All I will tell you is that one of the episodes in the Final Season is called Granite State.

  By now there's not much to add to the information out there about Breaking Bad. This seven-episode TV season is amazing TV art, great storytelling, and a total mess with your head. It's also a constant horror movie of ""oh no, that's a terrible decision you just made"" and ""wait - don't do the obviously-stupid thing!!""For me, it was interesting watching a TV series exploring a pitiful 50-year-old man and his pitiful 20-year-old sidekick, totally mis-matched, both of them losers and wash-ups in their own ways, living the American tragedy somehow - they don't even like each other! With violence just a step away, the only opportunities available are extremely dodgy. But it's fascinating watching Walt start to mutate from being one sort of person into another. Often these changes come across as being fairly sadistic, and yet also somehow liberating for our henpecked and browbeaten schlubby hero - series creator Vince Gilligan calls Walt's tale Jeckyl And Hyde story. Jesse, sadly, does not go through any such changes, and ultimately seems like a silly cast addition - possibly mis-cast - although as a foil he does a remarkable job; ironically, in the commentary section, we learn that there was originally a plan to kill him off at the end of the first season, but he seemingly was too popular to get rid of (or a proper replacement foil could not be created/cast). As a foil, and the occasional star of his own episode, he still works for the most part, and so it will be interesting to see if the character improves through the rest of the series or not.The pilot episode is some amazing film-making, and we get that great ending-to-the-beginning scene that creates tension (although they subsequently over-do it by repeating the concept by forecasting teaser scenes from Season Two mysterious finale to the entire season!!). Episode two doesn't let up, and we get a whole new facet to this conundrum that's completely amazing!! Funny stuff about Hank suspecting Walt Jr of smoking herb, and some family drama as Walt's family finds out about the cancer while Jesse tries to move back to his parents' place. There's a great family intervention at Walt's, some ancient history as we learn about Walt's past as a successful chemist torn apart by matters of the heart. The ""Crazy Handful of Nothing"" where Walt confronts Tuco (I bet the creators lifted that name from The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, although they don't admit it in the commentary) is completely amazing, as we see Walt applying his brains for a crazy plan; and Season One ends with some more Tuco insanity. Great!Watching the bonus features is great. There's audio commentary on two episodes (the pilot, episode one, and episode six, ""Crazy Handful of Nothin'""). The commentary is interesting, but nothing earth-shattering, as some of it is covered in the documentary pieces anyway; but at least it's not as drossy as some of the commentary on episodes where every single episode has a commentary track (hello, Simpsons). The pilot commentary includes nearly everybody who was involved with the show - all the actors, the producer and director and editor. The group's in good spirits, as it's a week after their big Emmy wins. They note that the cinematographer for that episode, John Toll, won an Oscar back-to-back for Legends of the Fall and Braveheart. The first scene shot was the stake-out scene/ride-along. The soundtrack music composer, Dave Porter, was a student of Phillip Glass. John Koyama needed to get a legal release from his tattoo artist before he could show them in the episode. Breaking Bad was originally written for another network, FX, but they didn't use it. The ""Crazy Handful Of Nothin'"" commentary mentions how an episode is finished in eight days, and then on to the next one, but that the pilot had been done in 16 days. Director Bronwen Hughes is Canadian, and the producers had noticed her film Stander, about Captain André Stander, a South African police officer turned bank robber. There's some interesting commentary about the washroom puke scene - originally it was performed with lots of visuals, but it was deemed too disgusting, so they recycled an unused scene that had been intended for a different use - Walt was supposed to masturbate after receiving some negative diagnosis, but this was left out of the final season (put in a different context, the gripping hands become convulsions of a different sort). There's commentary about Carmen Serano and her ""onion butt"" that is a bit insulting. The ""crazy handful of nothin'"" cards scene was originally to be done in a bowling alley, but this worked better.Then there's an introductory ""Inside Breaking Bad"" (32:00) documentary that has creator insights like ""Walt's the smartest dumb guy that I know"", and ""Jesse's not as greedy as Walt""; it's done in online snippets, which is a bit irritating, as each has its own intro and outro. Creator Vince Gilligan talks about how he reveres the dialogue in The Sweet Smell Of Success, and how the episode titles are often references to one movie or another (""Crazy Hatful Of Nothin'"" is from Cool Hand Luke, ""A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal"" is from Fargo). He notes that the series ""needs a little humour, or it would be unwatchable."" I found this definitely the case in the early episodes, as they were too tense to ever watch more than two in a row, but black humour later shines through, particularly in the Jehovah's Witnesses hallucination scene, and a few other little gems. ""The Making Of Breaking Bad"" (11:00) then describes Walt as ""a caterpillar who turns into a meth-cooking butterfly"" (not sure I buy that butterfly symbolism), how they turn Mr Chips into Scarface over 10-50 episodes (better), and how Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the Odd Couple for the 21st century (true, true...). There are also funny underwear tales.The extras section also include four amazing screen tests. There's Jesse and the ""I'm awake"" scene, which is so-so. He's just a goofy stoner with a bit of baby-faced edge. Skyler runs through the eBay stroke scene from Walt's 50th birthday, which she plays amazingly straight-faced despite the guffaws of bystanders (and a ton of laughter at the ""I will now"" line); some amazing professionalism here, and she plays it just like in the episode. Then there's Marie and the first eBay folk art motif mention, and Hank's ""towellhead"" speech and the ride-along. ""AMC Shootout: Interview with Vince and Bryan"" is a nice, chatty interview that gets a bit edgy, and we see how different Bryan Cranston is from Walter White - great sense of humour, very smart and fast. ""Breaking Bad on AMC"" is a 0:55 thing, too short, while ""Vince Gilligan's Photo Gallery"" contains 24 pics from behind the scenes that I'd call so-so.There are a few deleted scenes, of varying quality. The best by far is for Episode 7, when Walt and Jesse have an extended ""I have a plan"" speech in Jesse's house that sounds a bit gay when part of it is overheard by the real estate agent that is trying to help Jesse it. Nice! ""Walt and Skyler arrive at the party"" (1:00) is nothing interesting as it mostly repeats the final scene and doesn't add anything of interest, nor is ""Target practice"", which shows Badger shooting his crossbow in the desert. ""Walt's birthday speech"" (2:00) is interesting because it makes Hank look like the guest of honour (glory hogger), and it has a geeky calculation of how many minutes there are in 50 years. ""Walt Jr helps his dad"" (1:39) is a waste of time, as is ""Walt shows Jesse the goods"" (3:15, but 2:25 of that is a repeat of what's in the actual episode).

  Breaking Bad is an American crime drama thriller produced by Vince Gilligan. His story about a bright, high school chemistry teacher named Walter White who is diagnosed with lung cancer. As he struggles financially he has no choice but to live the life of a criminal. Thanks to his brilliant mind and the help of former student named Jesse Pinkman, together they produce crystallized methamphetamine. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) performs with such believable acting, his interactions with the other characters and reactions to major events is enough for the viewer to watch the next episode. The interactions between the characters give of a realistic scene in which one would act in the real world. As with the great acting, the storyline seems to fit smoothly as the show progresses. The opening episode featured an RV racing down a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Such an opening is enough for the viewer to feel the suspense. Vince Gilligan did a great job starting the show with a suspenseful scene, this way it made the viewer curious as to how it lead to this event. Breaking Bad is an excellent crime drama TV show because it has strong acting and good writing. Like every movie or TV show, acting is a crucial part for its success. How they act and interact with other characters and the reactions when a major event happens can have a major impact on how a viewer would rate them. And in this business it’s all about the ratings. Bryan Cranston is an exceptional actor and in breaking bad he “becomes” Walter White. On the second episode he starts producing meth and gets more involved with other criminals. Spoiler alert he ends up murdering someone with science. At this point we know that Walter White does not handle stressful situations very well. And as the viewer I can actually believe that because his reactions are convincing. He may be a great actor, but it doesn’t just take good acting skills to make a successful film. An actor can only be so great if the storyline is as well. Breaking Bad starts out with rush, it got the viewer curious which is an excellent strategy for any film because it keeps the viewer wanting more. When an old RV races down a dirt road in the middle of nowhere with two dead bodies, an unconscious passenger, and a clearly stressed driver wearing a gas mask, the viewer will get curious. Aside from the start of the first episode the rest seems to flow smoothly. Although one would say it was a lot to take in with so much information crammed into one. That being said that really isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact it really helped the viewer get a good idea as to what the show will be about. Walter White didn’t start out as a criminal. As the episode progressed, we learned he struggles with money and has issues with his health which lead Walter White to break the law to make more money. The director, Vince Gillian did a great job with keeping the storyline flowing from noncriminal to criminal. With strong acting and a good writing Breaking Bad has dominated viewer ratings and I couldn’t agree more. Vince Gillian really out did himself to put together a masterpiece. So if anyone is seeking for a late night show to watch on Netflix, I highly recommend Breaking Bad. Viewer discretion is definitely advised.

  Ryan StovernCarl BennettEnglish 101-705/02/18  Chemically Devient TeacherBreaking Bad is a thrilling action crime drama which portrays Walter White(Bryan Cranston) as a high school chemistry teacher who is in a poor financial life with his son Walter White Jr(RJ Mitte) and his wife Skyler White(Anna Gunn). Mr.White is tragically diagnosed with stage four lung cancer and is forced to break bad and start cooking meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman(Aaron Paul) in order to support his family from impending financial disaster.Breaking Bad is one of the best television shows winning many academy awards for their performances and has many strong attributes contributing to the success of the film such as groundbreaking cinematography and its character dynamics.Breaking Bad wonderful cinematography portrays Vince Gilligan vision of the show and how it should be told and from what point of view it should be shot from. Vince Gilligan shows us many close ups and shaky self shot film to make it believable that Mr.White himself is shooting the video himself. One example of dramatic  cinematography is when Bryan Cranston is in the doctor's office and the camera is focused in on Mr. White as he is told he has stage four cancer then the camera gets closer and closer to his face to demonstrate the seriousness of the situation. Cinematography is only one part of how Breaking Bad got its claim to fame it also has to do with the chemistry of the actors and how well the character dynamics match the situations.Character dynamics is everything in Breaking Bad because of how serious the situations are and how violent the crimes they are committing.Character dynamics play a role in this t.v. series because they need to establish relationships with each other and make the audience believe they are actually the characters and are having to actually break bad in order to survive. One example of character dynamics is when Mr.White and Jesse have Crazy Eight tied up in the basement and are having to flip a coin to see who is going to dispose of the body out in the RV and who is going to kill Crazy Eight and Mr.White and Jesse  just look at each other in shock of what they have done and they make it believable they have committed this crime and they are having to deal with the real life consequences of their actions.Breaking Bad is one of the greatest tv shows out there because of the exemplary performance from the actors and making us ,the audience, believe they are actually the characters along with great cinematography that portrays every serious moment and makes the scenes intense is what makes Breaking Bad one of the best tv shows out there and would definitely recommend to anyone

  You've probably read lots of positive reviews, so I want to aim this one at those who don't watch the show because it ""Glorifies Drugs"" (or some similar statement).  I have a friend who said something like that when I asked if he'd seen the show.  For those living under a rock ""Breaking Bad"" is about a chemistry teacher who starts cooking meth to dig himself and his family out of a hole.After watching this show for a while (I'm in Season Four right now, and I know it gets darker) I think I can pretty confidently say that the show doesn't glorify it at all in my opinion.  You might chuckle at some of the early stuff, but it gets right down to brass tacks and shows you the road to corruption such a world can take one down.  An action leads to a decision, that leads to a choice that, leads to even worse choices and hundreds of people end up dead.  You may not have killed them yourself, but your actions did.  There are points in the series where collateral damage leaves more blood than they bargained for on their hands in both direct and, ever worse sometimes, indirect ways.  It's not glorifying drugs: it's almost a five year long anti-drug ad.The only reason I give this Season 1 four stars is because it gets better.  The measuring stick is basically the future episodes/seasons.  The show is very original, well written, well acted, and just overall extremely well put together as a whole.

  I JUST finished this first season tonight, I have 2,3,4,& 6 and just need season 5. I've finished House and Criminal minds and needed a new show that I would love and had no idea what to get, either Breaking Bad or Dexter or Buffy the Vampire Slayer were the only ones I had interest in, but I knew very little about this show and had much hesitation, but a friend of mine who is a HUGE fan insisted that I watch this, so I got most the seasons taking a gamble not knowing what I would think.... I LOVE IT! This first season was absolutely great and totally exciting! I could NOT wait to start the next episode, the one thing that makes this show stick out among any show that I have EVER seen is how REAL it feels, I mean this is exactly how I imagine it would happen and that nothing about this show is unrealistic, and the characters are so real and human, they don't just seem like actors, each episode brings us a new day and unpredictable events, we care about the characters and enjoy getting to know them and hope everything will turn out for them. I love how much humor was in the last 4-5 episodes too, this is truly an exciting show, can't wait to start season 2! I do wish that there was more action/violence/gore and less sex, but whatever, I am sure there will be more violence as it goes on. Anyone who is unsure of if they should watch this, check it out, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this first season!Breaking Bad: Season 1 ***** out of *****Violent Content: 5/10 - Strong Violence and Severe Bloody Beatings and a Scene of Brief Gore.Sexuality/Nudity: 5/10 - Some Strong Graphic Sexuality and Brief Nudity.

  I love this show and won't bother to echo the many good reviews.  I'm just adding my hit on the symbolism of the names.  ""Walter"" is reminiscent of ""Walter Mitty"" the repressed, nerdy guy who dreamed of bigger things. ""White""---well he is the prototype good guy, lilly white and always doing the right thing. (This is great fodder for Jungian analysts.) ""Schwartz"" as they explain, his ex-colleague in grad school, means ""black"" and he has stolen Walt's ideas and made a fortune from them.  They had together formed ""Gray Matter"" which included both of them but apparently Schwartz got greedy and cheated out Mr. White.  Then there is the interesting Jesse Pinkman---who is neither all white in his behavior nor all bad. (I came to love Jesse.)  He spills his share of blood but shows a good heart.  Then...the sexy, hot and beautiful assistant principal, Carmen, (red, if you don't already know) who seems to have the hots for the suffering White.  I'm only in the beginning of the second series so I hope to see more of Senorita Carmen.So far, so good....looking forward to more..in spite of too much violence for my taste.My only complaint is that some of those home homes don't look like any I've seen in Albuquerque and I've lived there.  All those leafy trees and green lawns....looks more like Southern California or Michigan than anything I've seen in New Mexico.

  A very dark and frequently difficult series to watch about a protagonist slowly transitioning from the role of a mild-mannered Chemistry teacher into a drug lord. What makes the show so fascinating isn't just the character study but in seeing how Walter White manages to pull this deception off, with clever twists and tricks to keep the secrets of his meth industry. The characters are all well-written and believable. The world of drugs is not glamorized at all, in fact there's a very difficult episode to watch involving Walter's partner Jesse trying to retrieve money from two far-gone drug addicts with a small child unexpectedly in the picture. Kudos to the writers for their ability to blend drama, horror, suspense and even comedy into so many of these episodes. The series contains strong violence, profanity, and of course drug usage.

  it took a few episodes to really get into the rythem of this series. From the start anyway I was definately addicted. But by the end of seaon 1 I knew this is the kind of television that goes far beyond the typical material. It's powerful stuff. By season 2 of found my self so additcted that I couldn't watch less than 3 episodes at a time. I've seen every season of The Sopranos, and every season of 24, and up until I discovered this series I thought TV couldn't get any better, but I was definately wrong. This is riveting story tellling. The tension, realism, originality, and creative visuals makes this probably this best series I think I have ever seen on TV. At times gut wrenching. Other times brutally realistic. And at other times suprisingly heart touching. Never predictable and always absolutely top notch and exciting story telling. Its bold, powerful and simply unlike anything you've ever seen before. Season 1 was grade A, but season 2 is so completely astounding it's hard to imagine anything coming close to the masterful achievement this series had acomplished. It's simply breathtaking story telling I can't recommend enough., This rates as the best in television hands down. Fantastic visuals, incredible writing, and might I be as bold to say that Vince Gilligan is truly a gifted writer and director. This is simply an astounding achievement in film making, Be it television or motion pictures. I can't recommend this series enough.

  I wasn't interested in watching this, until I started watching it. I watched the first episode, and was like "" meh "". I figured i'd give it a second chance, and started watching the other episodes. I immediately fell in love. It's an amazing show that's not really all that far fetched at all. However, it does come with it's share of problems. This show did not focus enough on the entire plot of the series, the dude sells Meth. You don't even find out about the blue meth until it's been shown in one scene, then all the sudden it's the "" hottest "" thing on the streets. It's not an ideal situation. You see very little of the choices the main actor has to make in regards to making meth. So while it's easy to follow, you often find yourself wondering, hmmm how did that come about.This show also has a lot of "" heart to heart "" moments, where you may spend 10 minutes just watching a conversation of people talking. That doens't take away form the goodness of the show, however, it does make it a bit boring at times.

  I was somewhat unusual among many viewers of Breaking Bad in that I watched some of the first season when it originally came out and did not care much for it. A few years passed and I decided to give it another try; in the process, I was surprised how much my perspective of the show had changed. Although I regard the first season as perhaps the weakest of the series, it is still far above most television in its visuals, soundtrack selection, and acting. Without giving away much of the plot, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a milquetoast chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with lung cancer. Fearing for his family's financial future after his death, he approaches his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) with a proposal that they cook methamphetamine together. Given his technical background, the quality of Mr. White's product is far above anything else available. Thus starts a relationship that will lead both over five seasons down a path of moral quandaries neither had anticipated.As for the DVD itself, it is a fine product, although if you have the money, it might be a good idea to buy the series box set. There are all nine episodes of the first season in three discs, with accompanying director and actor commentary. This season is shorter than the following four because they were unsure if it would be renewed. The main advantages to buying the DVD over going online are permanency and the fact that the DVD is uncensored. That should become apparent in the first episode. As a final point, although this is clearly a great series, I obviously would not recommend it for young kids. There is sexual behavior, drug usage, violence, and strong language throughout. These are the very things that make it great because they all contributed to White's ultimate moral downfall, but nonetheless I thought it important to warn  the unknowing viewer.In sum, a great show and this season is a great introduction for those unfamiliar with the premise.

  With Breaking Bad currently airing the first half of its final season, I obviously arrived late to the party having just finished the first and second season. Until recently all I knew about the show was that it involved meth, starred Bryan Cranston, and was highly acclaimed. I don't watch too many television shows, but I questioned how a channel like AMC would be able to pull off this kind of material effectively. As you likely know, these questions are unwarranted. It's difficult to review the seven episodes that make up the first season without taking the brilliant second season that followed it into account. I believe this is why the first season is held in such high regard now and I think the reviews tend to reflect one's opinion of the show as a whole rather than this specific group of episodes. Because it's the first season and it was cut short by the writer's strike (from nine to seven episodes), the first season of Breaking Bad isn't as compelling as the season that followed it. This is not due to lower production values or weaker writing, merely the amount of exposition it takes to set up a series and the way Breaking Bad carefully establishes its characters. Perhaps this is biased itself as I'm judging this season based on how great the following season was. However, in regards to these seven episodes; the first three intrigued me, the fourth and fifth served as appropriate dramatic segues, and the final two episodes are nothing short of astounding. The show is undeniably a masterwork, but the first season sets up the masterpiece; it isn't one itself.At this point it seems superfluous to provide a synopsis, but it helps provide context. Walter White (Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher, with a second job at a car wash, living with his pregnant wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and their disabled son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). Shortly after his 50th birthday he's diagnosed with stage-three terminal lung cancer. With no health insurance and stress piling up, he keeps his diagnosis secret from his family. With the financial burden weighing on him, Walt begins looking for a way to make money when his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris) mentions how lucrative cooking meth can be. By chance, Walt notices Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), a former student of his, sneaking out of a house that Hank has busted. Walt's extensive knowledge of chemistry makes him able to cook highly potent meth and he blackmails Jesse into assisting him in the cooking and distribution. Shortly into Walt's newfound career, things go awry. I should add; this all happens in the pilot episode, which works like a self-contained movie. It's an impressive introduction.The second episode amps up the excitement with a shocking story arc that comes to a dramatic conclusion in the third episode. The fourth and fifth episodes are, as I mentioned, dramatic segues that put the focus on the characters and give them the depth necessary for us to start to care about them. These episodes are the least compelling, but they provide some of the most powerful dramatic moments of the season. The sixth episode debuts bald Walter, the look of the character that has become iconic as well as introducing Tuco (Raymond Cruz), the psychotic and powerful drug distributor with the power to lead Walter and Jesse to a big payday.The last two episodes are so intensely well-written and well-acted they immediately elevate the series. Each episode seems to improve upon the previous one and every creative decision that goes into forming the framework of the show is a success. A lot happens in only seven episodes, and every new character, every new conflict, seems inspired. The season ends on a high-note, opting to point the series in an intriguing direction rather than ending on a cheap cliffhanger. There's a real confidence in the direction of this series and the way it is put together.If the first season is slightly less than perfect, it's only because of necessary exposition. Every event here provides the catalyst for the rest of the series. Every episode of season one gets more intriguing and suspenseful; with season two, it only gets better.So what makes it so good? Well, you never get the impression that you're watching a television show. The cinematography, the pacing, the acting, the dialogue, the look, the feel of the show make Breaking Bad simply feel like a long movie. Bryan Cranston is a phenomenal actor who finally got people to take notice with this role and had this been a movie his work would be Oscar worthy. Aaron Paul also gives a terrific performance, one that takes a few episodes to grow on you and the love-hate chemistry he shares with Cranston is palpable.AMC is not HBO and there are FCC regulations, yet nothing about the content of the show ever feels restrained. There's violence, language, and sex; yet it's done tastefully and it works. This whole review is ultimately superfluous as I'm sure anyone reading it has already started watching the series. However, I must add to the pile of acclaim; this is one of the best shows on television and the first season is a special and unique introduction to it. Friends of mine had tried to convince me to watch this show for some time and I put it off. Don't make the same mistake. This show is almost as addictive as the drug it's based around and, similarly, it only gets more addictive the further in you go.

  Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother-in-law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the ""righteous"" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, glass, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.Molecular visuals of METH.Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment-resistant depression.After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, ""the blue stuff"", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic-fail, they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side, embraced them--the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth-head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half-patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true-love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind-gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.DISCUSSION:I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug ""meth"" by amateurs in their own ""RV super lab""? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?

  Yeah, I know...you read a lot of the rave reviews, and you can't believe it's that good. Well, it is. And I'm one of most cynical, anti-p.c. programming types you'll find anywhere. You'll find none of the usual p.c. garbage in BB. But most importantly it's simply a great story. All the actors do  great jobs. I guess maybe it's the quality of the show and the scripts, but there's not one weak performance. I don't think I have to go over much of the details of the plot about a high school chemistry teacher stricken with cancer who is determined to leave his family not in a destitute situation, gets into the methamphetamine biz, and finds himself entangled in situations he finds harder and harder to divorce himself from. Another angle to the plot is the fact that he eventually seems to grow into the new and far more sinister life and character he claims he really isn't. There are some minor plot quibbles about a chemistry genius who is just a high school teacher and the fact that his medical bills would not in reality be as dire as the the show makes them out to be, but you'll forget all that minor caviling very quickly. One of the many great plot devices are the little snippets of odd-looking scenes at the beginning of many episodes that reveal themselves later on to be much more pertinent than they seem. Interesting to find out the actor who plays Walter White Jr. (Mitte) actually has c.p. The wife and I are now waiting for the 5th season dvds to arrive after starting watching season 1 what seems like just a few weeks ago. In fact, she's a little irate at me for not ordering the version that gets here quicker. Get the dvd version to get the uncensored stuff.

  The first season of this series is only seven episodes long. Each episode is about an hour in length. There are a few extras of short interviews with the cast and crew.Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a middle aged man living in a suburb outside of Albuquerque New Mexico. He has a pregnant wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), due in a couple of months, and a teenage son with cerebral palsy, Walt Jr. (R. J. Mitte). He has a very obnoxious brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris) who is a very big goofball and D.E.A. standout. Hank's wife, Marie (Betsy Brandt) is just as annoying and likes to butt into her sister and husband's life. Walt is a high school chemistry teacher, something that he has lost his flare for over the years. All in all, a pretty mundane world for Walt and his family.Walt is informed he has lung cancer.Quite a lousy turn of events for Walt. In order to spare his family he hides the information and takes his brother-in-law's advice of coming along with him on a drug bust. It will help ""man him up"", is Hank's advice. While the D.E.A. agents are busy raiding a normal suburban house, Walt notices a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) slipping away. Walt withholds this information and is stunned by the reveal of how much money is in the business of selling methamphetamine: crystal meth. Walt feels that he will not live long and instead of leaving his family with bills and burden, he will secretly make meth and sell it with the help of Jesse.This show is nothing short of amazing. The story. The performances. Incredible. These seven episodes give a great look at a specific drug problem going on in the midwest to pacific time zones of the United States with a grounding with a middle class family struggling to get by. The show does not judge it's characters for their situations of their actions. It simply lets their circumstances and decisions unfold in as objective a way as possible. The show is a hard hitting drama but does have some good comedic moments, especially playing up Walt's fish out of water scenario.This show is in a current line of cable and premium channel viewing that follows a character/characters that have flaws that violates our societies taboos. Other that I have tried but have lost interest in are: ""Dexter"", ""Boardwalk"", ""Justified"", and ""Homeland"". It is an interesting pattern that has been developing over the past several years. It goes against the simplified ""good guy"" versus ""bad guy(s)"" pattern. Usually, someone on the side of the law taking on an ""evil"" person to a misunderstood person breaking the law.  It instead takes the basic of creating fictional drama in having a protagonist versus an antagonist. The issue here is the protagonist may be working against the law and doing morally questionable things. Dexter is the most extreme in that he is a serial killer and enjoys his ritualistic style of killing. Now, the antagonist(s) are almost the same as the protagonist to being on the side of the law. A very unique era for television.Walt is a very sympathetic character. He is doing a bad thing but for a good reason. Or so the viewer may feel, until thinking upon it more and analyzing the world we are presented and the characters a little more. One could be left to think is this also part of his condition? A last attempt to do something with his scientific mind? A chance to be more of the macho man society has  not typed cast him as? These are all present but as to how much of each is up to the viewer. Thankfully, the underrated Bryan Cranston was given this role to play this complicated man.These seven episodes can be watched in one sitting this show is that addictive. Episode five has to be the highlight for me. The beginning shows a beat up bad neighborhood with smoke filling the air. Sounds of panic and vehicles can heard taking off to avoid what seems to be the coming of the apocalypse. Big bad biker dudes stare in amazement at the figure the camera follows with such intensity. We cut to this larger than life figure and it turns out to be none other than Walt himself! Now with a shaved head, hard sneer, everyday man clothes, while clutching a duffel bag, daring anyone to come and get it. He gets in the car and slams the door. He looks up as if thanking God to still be alive. This is the roller coaster ride this show provides. And if that beginning to episode five does not cemment you in, this show is not for you. I am already through season three and cannot wait to view on.

  After the Breaking Bad series finale came and went this fall, I finally decided to check this series out and see what was generating all the buzz.In short, here's what's buzz-worthy: this is a show that is dark, witty, intriguing and tragicomic. It is relentlessly intense and populated with characters who could be treated in superficial ways in the hands of less skillful writers, but who end up being more complex that we we ever give them credit for when first introduced. They sometimes they act in ways that might surprise, yet don't defy logic. It takes fantastic advantage of the light terrain, scenery and culture of New Mexico to fully anchor it its location.This is not a show for the faint of heart or those uncomfortable with explorations of the margins of legal, ethical and interpersonal conventions. The violence is graphic and frequent, the language is adult, and the sexual situations are sometimes unconventional. You'll have to suspend some disbelief (why a full-time teacher is struggling with inadequate health care, and probably some law enforcement procedures related to one character to name a few), but not to an excessive amount.Mostly, Breaking Bad is a mature way to explore uncomfortable choices and to examine the many layers of a downward spiral.Baseball season is the the review mirror, and football season is ending soon. If you want some quality TV time in a show that targets thinking adults: Breaking Bad is an excellent choice. I wish I had the stamina to watch all 62 episodes in one sitting!

  I just read the commerical summary, above these reviews, on the 'sell'-page-It seems to imply that Cranston is reinvigorated, now that he is Stage 4,terminal cancer. And that his focus on making money, to leave his dear family, is a /fun way-to-go.Not even close. Then there are the reviewers who copy this summary and get top ratings for telling a lot of backdrop.Hey, by now, you probably know this is a gripping/brutal drama- about a drug that usually ruins lives. And the people who are in this so-called business, are putting their necks next to a commonly used chopping-board.If you really prefer the more realistic stories, you just may get pulled into this. If I knew the juist of the story, I might have turned away. It would not sell very well with a quick synopsis. But I had AMC on cable, was kind of  curious, there was hype..and blammo. Hooked. I tried to make strangers check it out. Partly because a lot of people have cable, often only for their kids. Few people paid attention to AMC..old movies. Its on the map now..oh yeah. And not cool for young kids- /block this.And, by the way, Breaking Bad is not to be compared to Sopranos, no way. That series was more about killing- AND eating, without a need to wash hands first. Not that impressive, but most of the characters were entertaining when not mashing brain0s out.This is a truly unique series. I thought there would be some kind of outrage about this, its that tough. So realistic,AND tough. I did not expect an award-winning success here. The public, wow, how sophisticated the audience has become. The critics did not condemn it either.You may just find, that you also, just have to keep watching..and maybe even go back in a year..to see the whole story open up again.Maybe try an episode..or season one..I wont get a commission, and my reviews are not making me a 'top contributor' either! But this is worth commenting on.  Great / gripping drama.

  Life is fragile and uncertain.  How does an intellectual deal with this,  create a narrative for his life ?PhDs, especially in the hard sciences from big name universities are often saddled with the life-long burden of needing to live the life of the mind- the intellectual, to have unique insights that no one else in the world has had, to see the big picture of humanity as only a feeble part of the great wonder of Nature.But then we are forced to live in this world, where most other people are incurious about what we seem to care about, instead mostly concerned about making money, maneuvering  for power - all to head to Costco at the end of the day, only to buy that 2 gallons of virgin olive oil or that 100 inch Flat TV newly on sale there.How do we get through this meaninglessness? How do we decide on the 'noble' course of action?And how do you get through, if you have just been diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 50, there is an unplanned pregnancy, and you are a very overqualified high school chemistry teacher?Walter Hartwell White does work that eventually leads to a Nobel Prize at CalTech. he founds a company but then drops out to teach high school, unappreciated by his students, and washing cars to make ends meet, for his family, especially his wife who doesnt seem to get him either.of course, we all know that he puts his knowledge of science of chemistry to cooking the best crystal meth -This setting seems unlikely, but results in the greatest TV show I have ever seen, combining great drama, social insight, suspense and even comedy.And even as the captivating end comes, we agree with him that he didnt do it 'for his family' but for himself ' he enjoyed it, he was good at it, and it 'made me feel alive'.

  I heard about Breaking Bad (BrBa) through word of mouth, and by the time season 4 was underway I picked up the first season, late on the bandwagon but still wowed. All of the seasons of BrBa are great, but they all sort of drag out what's going on, and while the tension and suspense are there I still have a hard time remembering each episode because a lot of them left me with blue balls. This season however short it is, moved at a lightning quick pace and barely gave me time to adjust my face.Breaking Bad's first season shows the beginning of Walt's transformation from unlucky high school chemist to criminal mastermind, and it's all fascinating because it's all circumstantial, Walt's almost forced into this new dangerous world because the other options are die and leave his family with nothing, and that's what makes BrBa different from say, Scarface since Tony was just a greedy thug in the first place, Walt is a family man.Basically season 1 chronicles Walt taking out his competition early on in New Mexico, and there are many memorable scenes and results from it, one of my favorite moments is Walter putting a plate back together and making a horrible discovery, you know the one. But pretty much episode after episode some new variable changes the game completely, keeping the whole season short and sweet; television writers take note.If you haven't seen BrBa before and are curious you need to stop reading this right now and get your hands on the whole series, season 1 especially starts out the show with a bang but by season 3 it starts to show it's stretch marks. Still Breaking Bad is proof that HBO has some competition.

  A chemistry teacher, Walter White, finds out he has terminal lung cancer and but a short few months to live. Determined not to tell his family, an unexpectedly pregnant wife, Skyler, and teenage son with cerebral palsy, RJ Mitte, he sets about preparing for his death by thinking of a scheme to leave them with the biggest amount of money possible - meth. A chance encounter with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, who is now a drug dealer, sets the wheels turning and the two become an unlikely team - he cooks the meth using his years of chemistry experience and Jesse distributes it. But how does he keep all of this secret from his family, especially his brother in law who is a Drug Enforcement Agent? Throw in the troubles that come with selling meth and the scene is set for one of the best TV series of the last 10 years.Bryan Cranston does a star turn in his role as Walter White, bringing an intensity and empathy to a character in such a way that he always gives a memorable performance in each episode and fashions a unique character along the way. Aaron Paul does a brilliant job bringing to life the character of Jesse Pinkman and giving him the humanity you perhaps wouldn't feel for a drug dealer. Anna Gunn does an even better job in the role of Skyler White than she did in her last role in ""Deadwood"" (another AMAZING series) and creates a complex and conflicted character with real depth.Though the first season is short (7 episodes) each one is packed with wonderful dialogue and plotting as we see Walter and Jesse bumble their way through the stages of creating a drug dealing business and overcoming the many obstacles along the way, namely rival dealers, and Walter juggling the time he spends away from his family cooking meth and hiding his illness. It all makes for utterly absorbing television and is yet another jewel in the crown of American drama TV, putting to shame British TV where all we seem to do is create exportable formats in the shape of talent contests, games of luck, and dance shows.""Breaking Bad"" is mesmerising TV and this is coming from a guy who rarely watches TV. After just 3 episodes I saw round a friend's house I had to buy the 1st and 2nd series and I was not disappointed in the least. You won't regret getting to know Walter White and Jesse Pinkman and their complex world. Roll on Season 3!

  My son purchased the complete 1st season; somehow had never gotten around to viewing this, but was well aware of the hype; well, they were right; the show is fantastic; episode 5 grey matter ranks among some of the best series individial episodes-particularly the intervention scene.  The script is brillant-perhaps some of the best juxtapositioning in a television series, that I have seen in a long while. In short, you see a man, Walter White, a  High School chemistry teacher already frustrated and simmering who is beset with a pregnant wife, a disabled son with cerebal palsy, and inadequate health insurance forcing him to take a menial job washing cars.. Topping this off, he receives a diagnosis of inoperable lung cancer which sets him on a course to cook up metamphetamine to raise money to leave his survivors.He hooks up with a former student-aka loser-addict to help him sell the product; naturally, they meet bad guys(I won't reveal what happens, but its a never-ending cascade of challenges, risks misperceptions, and misunderstandings from those closest to him, What this show has that most TV dramas lack is incredible depth of characterization; you feel for Walter; and although he is doing everything wrong, you find yourself rooting for him. This is 5-Star Television at its best!!!

  ...and for good reason! I am now done with the first season on DVD. If I had to describe this series in a single sentence, It would be: Abbott and Costello spend a ""Weekend at Bernie's"" in ""Fargo"".Without Walter's lung cancer and the sometimes gruesome crime aspects of the show, it would be totally worth watching as a situation comedy.Let's recap the main family characters: 50 yr. old Walter White (Bryan Cranston) could not be anymore square as the high school chem teacher until he learns of the life changing cancer. Wife Skylar (Anna Gunn) is a continually bewildered bystander...and pregnant. Teenage son Walt Jr. is handicapped (CP?) but for the most part he gets it. Sis-in-law Marie is a kleptomaniac married to Hank, who is some kinda DEA cop.So the prideful Walter must figure out how to pay for his cancer treatment. He is exposed to the idea of big bucks in cooking crystal meth through Hank's drug busts, and hooks up with Jesse, a loser, stoner, small time meth dealer and coincidentally a (bad) former student of Walter. And of course the brilliant chemist Walter is capable of cooking up the best crystal meth to ever hit the streets of Albuquerque, NM, so his talent becomes quickly recognized and valued in the ""biz"". From there, murder, mayhem and drug deals gone bad ensue and the series takes on the personality of the Coen Brothers' ""Fargo"". OK, now strap on your seat belt because every minute will either have you aghast in disbelief or rolling on the floor laughing your ass off.

  I got into this show late in the game, as it was heading into its final episodes to be exact. After watching hours of the AMC marathon leading up to the finale, I couldn't resist picking up the first couple seasons on DVD. First off, I'm glad I went with the DVD, which is uncensored, as opposed to instant video, which I've read over and over is not. Watching the show uncensored makes for a more authentic, cinematic viewing experience. The first season only has 7 episodes, so it's sort of the introduction to the crumbling world of Walter White. I don't see how anyone who watches the first two or three episodes can avoid being hopelessly hooked by this superbly written and acted, genre-blending show. ""Breaking Bad"" mixes elements of drama, action, thrillers, and even Westerns, and adds bits of dark comedy in presenting a unique,thoroughly entertaining story. Full of shocking twists, it never fails to drop my jaw with something completely unexpected. It's an addictive show I can't seem to get enough of.

  Believe the hype. This show is as good as they say. Bryan Cranston, who was the rock that held down Malcolm in the Middle, shows his range as an actor here, playing a wizard scientist who is dying--literally and spiritually--from a quiet, middle class life. He is a passive aggressive father to a disabled son and a loving but sometimes overbearing wife. His life has been a series of surrenders to bearable compromises with himself, and he is content teaching chemistry classes to disinterested high schoolers in Albuquerque. But once he finds out he has cancer, he comes up with the crazy scheme of cooking crystal meth to make money for his chemotherapy and to provide for his family. He doesn't have to break the law, but we see that he does it because it fills a primal urge. Being a criminal gives him the thrills and release he has long needed.Breaking Bad is not a simple cops and crooks show. Instead, it combines elements of heavy drama, action, Tarantino-like black comedy, and Hitchcockian thrills. As with the great Showtime series Dexter, it's very good at switching gears. And like Dexter, Breaking Bad is incredibly intense. It doesn't go for cheap shocks, and Cranston wisely plays his character as a tired, likeable everyman. What separates him from normal guys, however, is his genius with chemistry, which gives him powers that combine elements of superheroes and supervillians.Season 1 is only seven episodes long, but they are all excellent. This is top-notch television.

  I've been watching ""Breaking Bad"" on Netflix for the past few weeks... to say that this show addicting... that would be an understatement.One episode - that's all it takes before ""Breaking Bad"" sinks it unrelenting teeth into you. Credit must go to the pure, original concept - a chemistry teacher (dying of lung cancer) chooses to cook meth to secure his family's future - ""a chemistry teacher"" being our protagonist, Walter White (aka ""Walt"", or ""Mr. White"") - a very real character, with quirks of hilarity, and a perfect touch of gutsy badass that string you along through the first season, and propel you right into the next.""Breaking Bad"" pulls no stops - it lingers around extremely tense situations that hit home in the real world, madly fatiguing your emotions... but no sooner when you're at 'wits-end', the scene turns 180° and offers a wonderfully bizarre setting - one that is equally as tense - one that might have you timidly fantasizing about what YOU might do in Walt's shoes. This, sort of, 'yin-yang' plot is reflective of Walt's character - a family man, and drug dealer.As the seasons progress, the plot transforms into a monster. Unforgettable characters are introduced at every turn. The staple characters' situations grow, and become intertwined - all resulting in aesthetic complexity. The lines of good and bad become blurred beyond recognition.  Your love and hate (sometimes both, simultaneously) for the characters will waver almost every episode as you get COMPLETELY blindsided by extremities... it will put on the edge of your seat.If anyone asks me, this is undoubtedly my favorite TV series. I wish I could label myself with something less... contentious... but hey... you can't be satisfied watching Spongebob for the rest of your life, right?

  Easily the best longform storytelling I've ever seen. There are many excellent series out there, but I honestly don't have a second place that's even close. The writing, acting, directing, editing, etc is beyond phenomenal on this show. The content can get heavy at times, for sure, but it's definitely worth it. Make sure to check it out.

  Breaking Bad is an excellent TV drama; one of the best ever I my opinion.  If you are on the fence about committing to watching it my recommendation is to watch it.  Be patient and do not expect Scarface from the get-go; Season 1 starts slow but building the complex storylines that follow make this necessary.  BrBa is a story about a midlife high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with cancer.  In fear he will die and not be able to provide for his family he resorts to cooking methamphetamine.  The story's advancement, along with the evolution/devolution of everyone involved, is excellent.  Each season gets better and better; Bryan Cranston is brilliant as Walter White.  The ancillary characters are likewise acted terrific even though the characters they play are mostly unlikeable.  The camerawork is great and the New Mexico landscape is a great backdrop for the story.  The show is constructed with the talents of a feature movie.  My recommendation is to sign on for the ride and enjoy!  BrBa will go down as one of the greatest shows in TV history.

  Straight up one of the best, most creative, fierce, funny and outright insane shows I've ever seen. Literally from the first scene of the series (those who have seen it know what's up) this hits the ground at a frantic pace and never lets up. It is so wrong on so many levels, its a testament to great writing, acting and directing that despite how wrong it is you end up cheering for the main character pretty much from the jump and continue to do so atrocity after atrocity. TRIPPY. Lots of grey areas to explore in this series, and they do it very well. Don't expect anything to be straight forward, everything is subject to twists, and often brilliant ones. I really wish I could go into more detail but this is the kind of show you really don't want even the slightest hint of spoilers for. It deserves a 5 though, big time. BIG time. Cranston has become one of my favorite actors with this. Who knew Malcom's dad had such ferocity in him?

  This is the first season of what turns out to be a five season (year) on-going drama - far too long for my taste. A struggling high-school teacher (Walter White) is diagnosed with advanced, inoperable lung cancer and for some reason (I forgot) his insurance doesn't cover the treatment. (Unrealistic for a public-school employee.) A former employer/partner offers to pay for the treatment, but Walter's pride prevents him from  accepting the offer - instead, he pretends that his insurance has changed positions and is now covering treatment. Meanwhile, he sees a former student fleeing the scene of a meth lab bust that is led by his brother-in-law, a DEA agent. Walter decides this is the way for him to pay for his care and leave money for his family.

  Awesomely excellent series stands head and shoulders against anything else. You'll be glad when it ends, after 4 seasons, since it is so addictive you'll want to watch nothing else. It makes Hollywood Blockbusters look like amateur attempts. Finally, a tremendous and imaginative story gets the full treatment, such that a 2 hour movie could never achieve. The detail, realism, acting, and video quality are outstanding. Watch it in 1080p if you can. I used a Roku during the day, and my iPod Touch during the night (and no, I didn't get much sleep until the last episode was over). You'll never forget the experience of so human drama that sheds light on news we often read about but never know the real facts. Congratulations to the team that brought this tremendous series to life. It is full of life lessons that are so raw that you'll not want to miss a minute. It doesn't glorify drugs, but contrarily illustrates their devastating effects that ripple through society. You'll actually be a better person for having watched this incredible series.

  By now there really isn't a whole lot more to be said here. Some people object to the subject matter or Walter White's moral choices, but then that's largely the point, isn't it? As I sit here waiting for the final season to unfold in another week, I look at the cover to the Season One set and think about the Walter White that was. To have managed such an evolution in the central character of a television program in the manner it was done is a remarkable feat -- unprecedented, really. There's a lot to object to here in a moral and ethical sense, but as a fictional meditation on the nature of those choices -- and that's in large part what fiction is about anyway -- Breaking Bad is hard to beat. Everything comes together so well: Acting, production, writing. This is one of the great works of the screen, big or small. Highly recommended.

  watching Breaking Bad is an experience that worth all the time you might spend on such a show , the writing is superb , and I have never in my life thought that it will come a day when I say "" I watched that TV show, that was more moving or artful than any well written novel or that beats the sh** of a oscar-winning movie "", and believe me this one does, in a big timeBrayan Cranston gives a performance of such a high-bar and it's a class of acting mastery by all-right, when they say there are no bad single episode on all the 8 season run of the show , guess what ""THEY ARE DAMN RIGHT""Breaking Bad is one of these pivotal moments in Television History that I was lucky enough to live in the same time it was created, and if you still one of those people who didn't give it a try, read this ""what are you waiting for ?!!!!""this show sets the standard of grounded character development arc like you've never seen before ,I wish that one day they can come up with a similar achievement in TV drama , yet Breaking Bad just makes it almost a near immposible  formula to follow

  This show is NOt for kids. In fact ,  the lead character is a man driven by anger and humiliation to do everything that is wrong.  He literally breaks bad in his fifties as he condemned to die from cancer.  The show is well written with a large amount of very dark comedy in it.  It's very unpoliitcally correct in a bad way , but it also does depict how nasty some people are. Meth of course is destroying whole communities , so the writers picked the most offensive drug they could for the character to fall into. After all breaking bad pot man wouldn't be that offensive would it?  The acting is great , with  emmies' won by cast members over the years. This is not a nice show , but it is dark and horribly funny.  This looks best in hd of course.  SO a blu ray would be the best way to go. or hd video.

  This show is the worst show I've ever seen,i can't believe i wasted 3 seasons on this pile of crap.The show doesn't progress as it goes on just the same old bad story line.You have the old man with cancer and the drugie teenager making meth for money and then random boring stuff happens.

  We never got past the first three episodes, and it felt like torture to endure those.  We kept thinking ""it's got to get better"".  I should have known better than to purchase just by looking at the front cover showing they guy in his underwear.

  I watched this before the fifth , last season went on Amc ,on my iMac thru Netflix and it just reaches out and grabs you by the collar pretty much from the very start. Yes I have seen the Sopranos , great, but  not like this. If there any missteps they are hard to spot, and or unimportant. Bryan Cranston , Aaron Paul in particular give two of the best performances you will ever see, the whole cast is terrific . The writing will go down as being among the top in the business. You can't help but become invested in these characters, and surprised by them , no matter what they do  though you never lose sight of what Walt and Jesse once were and what they have been to each other. There are many edge of your seat moments, get ready, don't miss this , it was quite a ride.

  The unsettling tale of a good man turned bad out of desperation to not leave his family with mountains of debt.  What's the solution?  Open a meth lab with one of his old students and proceed down the dangerous path of operating with criminals and their drug lord overseers.  To complicate matters his brother-in-law is with the DEA, his wife is pregnant and his teenage son has cerebral palsy.  There's a lot of humor interwoven with the more serious themes which I can understand or this would be unwatchable.  The emotional arc of the main character, a borderline genius, is one of the more refreshing elements to watch.  Think from caterpillar to butterfly (but in a bad way).  Good to great supporting cast (Hank is the best).  Extremely clever uses of chemistry (especially with fulminated mercury). It has won several Emmies since 2008, including PeaBody Award (2008) and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (2010).  CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; HUMOR: B plus to A minus; CHEMISTRY USES: A; WHEN WATCHED: January 2011; MY GRADE: B plus to A minus.

  Bryan Cranston and company have turned this series into one of the best TV has to offer. It is intriguing, compelling and at times, quite shocking. Breaking Bad has mesmerized audiences by giving us a glimpse of what a man is willing to do when he feels he has little left to lose in life. Taking the final steps in the right direction, the producers of this show have hit the ""nail on the head"" with the theme of ""The Transformation Of Walt To Heisenberg."" We have been able to watch Walter White change before our very eyes into one of TVs most captivating characters and we want to see how it's all gonna end.5 stars all the way.

  Dark, gripping and unique!Emmy Award winner Bryan Cranston plays the role of Walter White, a chemistry teacher at a local high school trying make ends meet for his family. His wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) is pregnant and his son Walter White Jr. (RJ Mitte) is physically challenged.  The family are struggling financially and behind on bills.Walter tries to provide for his family by working two jobs.  He is a very intelligent chemist that can probably work anywhere and make a lot of money but yet he teaches chemistry to high school students (who have no care in chemistry) and then having to work part time at a car wash in which his students mock him for it.  To make matters worse, Walter has just discovered that he has inoperable lung cancer.Knowing that his family has no money, he doesn't tell his family about it.  In fact, he keeps the cancer to himself and with all the crap going in his life, this is the last thing he needs.Depressed and just out of it, he is surprised that his wife has a surprise 50th birthday party with all his friends and his family (with their friends).  He watches his sister-in-law Marie's boyfriend Hank (Dean Norris) is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agent on television and how he goes after the notorious drug dealers in New Mexico and has been successful. Always finding a way to poke fun at Walter's weakness, he offers Walter a chance to go on a DEA ride-along as they go after drug dealers.  But what catches Walter's eye is the discussion of how much money is made by these drug dealers.So, Walter decides one day to take on Hank's offer to  go on a ride along for a crystal meth bust.  He sees how chemistry is applied to crystal meth, how it's developed in their labs and how these drug dealers are making really crappy products.  With basic chemistry, he can cook the finest crystal meth and possibly make some money for him and his family.So, during the bust, he sees a former student named Jesse Pinkman escaping from the area of the drug bust.  Walter goes to Jesse's residence after the busts and tells him that he wants to join forces with him.  He'll create the best crystal meth using his intelligent chemist skills and Jesse finds a way to make money.In an unlikely collaboration, both Walter and Jesse begin to work with each other.  But because Walter's crystal meth is perfect, Jesse's distributor want to know who's cooking it.  Thus they go to where Walter is cooking and threaten the both of them. In trouble, Walter uses his chemistry skills to create a cloud of poison and thus killing the drug dealers.Caught up in a botched up drug deal, both Walter and Jesse have now crossed the line and now have murdered one and keeping the other captive in the basement of Jesse's home.Walter goes from a ho-hum life to a criminal life involving drugs, theft and murder.  And because he needs money badly, he gets him and Jesse farther into criminal territory with ruthless drug dealers.  Meanwhile, his sister-in-law's DEA boyfriend is on the hunt for the person creating the perfect crystal meth.The first season of ""BREAKING BAD"" features a total of seven episodes.

The third disc features the final episode and even more special features.VIDEO & AUDIO:""BREAKING BAD"" is featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The video quality is similar to a lot of dramas that are on DVD but because of the many outdoor scenes, the quality of the film is pretty good.  Not flooded with grain.As for the audio, the audio is English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The audio is primarily dialogue with no need for special effects or rear channel usage.  There is music that come strong through your speakers but overall, this is a dialogue-driven TV series.

Plus deleted scenes.DISC 2: Audio commentary on episode 6 ""Crazy Handful of Nothin'"" by creator and cast including Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston.  Plus deleted scenes.DISC 3: There are a good number of special features on the third disc such as:  * Making of ""Breaking Bad"" - An 11-minute featurette featuring the behind-the-scenes filming.  Enjoyable and showing the wit of Cranston and the cast joking of how Cranston likes to be pants-less.  Interview with the cast and crew.  And the cast talking about creator/writer Vince Gilligan is such a gentleman and so nice but his screenwriting for ""Breaking Bad"" is dark, shocking and twisted.  * Inside ""Breaking Bad"" - A 30-minute featurette featuring interviews with Vince Gilligan and the cast.  Especially the gory scene in episode 2 as acid is used to rid of a body and how they made the body parts.  This featurette includes interview with the cast.

An intelligent discussion among professionals.  * Screen Tests - The actual screen tests for Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris.  * Breaking Bad on AMC - The AMC commercial for ""Breaking Bad""JUDGMENT CALL:What an excellent series ""BREAKING BAD"" turned out to be.  I was really impressed by the Vince Gilligan's writing and the talent of Bryan Cranston (who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ""BREAKING BAD"") in such a demanding role.I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching the series because I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch a television series that may glorify crystal meth and it's good to know that the series doesn't.In fact, it's more about a television series about a very intelligent man making a very stupid decision that will eventually take him to the lowest of lows in order to make money for his family and his treatment.It's so shocking that Walter H. White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.And that is what is so impressive with ""BREAKING BAD"" is that it's a series that is well-written, smart but dark, shocking and even disturbing at times.  And what helps break from the typical dark and depressing storylines is the other characters and the chemistry these characters have with the main character of Walter White.Anna Gunn as Skyler White, a loving wife, mother and sister other does an excellent job of playing a character with so many layers.  In one scene, she may be the concerned housewife and then another scene, the sultry wife who wants to make love to her husband.Then you have Walter's chemistry with the drug dealer Jesse.  Two unlikely people who would never be together in society but now having to work with each other in making money and despite the viewer feeling empathy for Walter because of his health condition and trying to make ends meet for his family, you can foresee nothing but darkness as both Walter and Jesse continue the downward spiral of working in the criminal underground.You see Walter eventually understanding that he put himself in a terrible position.  Having to work with unstable drug dealers, watching Jesse getting beaten and bloodied and even these two having to get involved in various criminal activities.This is not a television series glorifying drugs, it's a series that shows the seedy, dark and gritty criminal underground and things are not all rosy.  I was shocked about the developments that happen in the series which I rather not spoil for the viewer but you have to watch and see for yourself.  Definitely many twists and turns in this television series.Overall, ""BREAKING BAD"" is a unique, well-written and well-acted television series.  Surprisingly, AMC of all cable networks to showcase two exceptional dramatic series (the other is ""MADMEN"") is impressive and you can only think of how far this series will go.  The first season for ""BREAKING BAD"" really was surprising, entertaining and unique.  I was very impressed and looking back, I'm still quite shocked about a few certain scenes.An excellent television series thus far and I look forward in the upcoming twists and turns for the second season.  ""BREAKING BAD - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" is definitely recommended!

  I've always wanted to check out this series.  It's been more an issue of time - once it got rolling I missed too many episodes to keep up.  When a friend loaned me the first season, I instantly got addicted.  Yes, this plotline is rife with issues of morality, social consciousness and even karma.What hit me the hardest is the show's ability to tackle those subjects in a true to life form for TODAY's society.  The drug using youth culture looks at meth in much the same way that children of the 70's and 80's looked at weed or coke - as recreation.  Gilligan and Cranston decided early on not to beat the drum of self-restraint and accountability related to the drug culture, but to characterize the dark alley nature of the trade so that all ages can relate to its dire pitfalls - because drug use after all has never really changed - only the menu items have.And that helps us focus on Cranston's Walter White and his supreme conflict of cobbling together a nest egg for his family for when he's gone.  It's implied but you always get the ironic sense that White feels an invincibility, ever so fleeting in the most difficult of times (i.e. as a hostage of Tuko...).  And that he attaches as much importance to his mentorship of Aaron Paul's Jesse character as he does to the ""moral high ground"" of providing for his family.This show has places to go, and each episode injects a bit more empathy and hope for White.  In spite of his obvious flawed choices, he seems to be trying to do the right thing for the given circumstances.  You have a prevailing sense (or maybe wish) of one thing - he and Jesse will somehow come out on the right side of the moral conflict.  If and how he gets there will be the big excitement of this series.

  ""Breaking Bad..."" it's really hard to put into words.  When you try to tell somebody about it, they just give you a weird look and wonder how in the hell you can root for somebody who is making crystal meth.  To be honest, just saying that right now makes it hard for even me to believe it's possible, but that is the brilliance of the show.  When you see it all laid out, you understand and even sympathize with the main characters, even if you despise what they're doing.  This is one helluva show filled with drama, excitement and dark comedy.Walter H. White has a serious problem on his hands.  While he is an absolute genius when it comes to chemistry he is only able to make good of it by being a high school teacher and work part-time at a car wash just in order to support his family.  When he finds out that he has lung cancer and will most likely only have a few more years to live, everything changes.  He wonders how in the world he'll be able to make sure his family is in good shape by the time he's gone, and that's no easy task when there's a baby on the way.When he goes on a ride along with his brother-in-law (who is a DEA agent) and sees the amount of money that is made from meth labs--and also finds out that a former student of his is a dealer--he gets an idea on how he can provide for his family after all.  He will use his smarts in chemistry and break just about every respectable rule he has lived by.  At the start, he believes that this can be done without bloodshed and that deals can be legit, but it doesn't take long for him to figure out that this isn't the case after all.  Needless to say, Walt will end up making one hell of a character arc throughout these first 7 episodes as him and his former student Jesse will always be in constant danger.  There is nothing safe and pretty about the drug business, and Walt will find out how far he will have to go.The series is AMAZINGLY written, and again it is filled with characters you normally wouldn't sympathize with.  In that way it is kind of like ""Dexter"" where you know the main character is doing some terrible things, yet you are rooting for him and you get very nervous when things go wrong for him.  My brief outline of the show does it no justice at all, and I admit that.  This is something you just have to see for yourself.  Bryan Cranston is superb and deserves the Emmys he has won for this show.  His transformation throughout the show is spellbinding.Since this is the first season and it is a short first season, most of this is putting all of the pieces into place.  That doesn't mean that it drags or is boring.  Far from it!  Every episode is engaging and there isn't a moment where you don't feel invested in what is going on.  The Blu-Ray edition has great picture and sound quality and offers a couple of special features such as behind-the-scenes featurettes and commentary on certain episodes.""Breaking Bad"" is proving to be one of my favorite shows, and this is only after seeing the first season.  I cannot wait to start Season 2, and from what I've heard of it, it's even more intense and on-the-edge.  While this show will not be for everyone, anyone who likes a dark and challenging series should give it a try.  Once you start that first episode, you'll find it very hard to stop.  An amazing show all the way!  - Michael Crane

  My family was addicted from the first episode!  The writing is so clever, crisp and unique.  The acting catches you up and doesn't let you go.  We would sit down saying that we were only going to watch one episode and end up watching three!  Time flies by and you are completely caught up in a story about an over-qualified high school chemistry teacher who gets a death sentence (lung cancer) and decides to cook and sell meth to make enough money to provide for his pregnant wife and his 15 year-old son who has muscular dystrophy.  When I heard that description of this series, I was under-whelmed and avoided watching it until the final season was set to begin...but my daughter talked us into it.  THANK GOODNESS SHE DID!  It is one of the BEST series I've ever seen on TV.  I highly recommend it!

  Usually trendy critics talk up American cable TV these days and constantly claim we're in a golden age of television.  I would have to disagree on that.  Most shows have some interesting plot devices, but overally are just light and quirky, occasionally dark, but hardly the deep, penetrating dramas that they purport to be.Not Breaking Bad.This is a really electric, intense show, with a fascinating premise and a great, brilliant lead performance by Bryan Cranston.  The story is about a chemsitry teacher turned meth dealer because he wants to make a lot of cash quickly.  He's dying of cancer.  Many critics have said he does this because he wants money for his family, but I don't think that's the case.  Mr. White (Bryan's character) has been a milquetoast his whole life, seeing friends and relatives of his earn mega bucks while he struggles as a high school chemistry teacher (and working part time at a car wash to make ends meet).  After his diagnosis, he ""breaks bad"" and doesn't want to be a good boy anymore.  While he cares about the family, there's more to his madness than just ""helping support his family"".  He goes to the other side, and he can't return.  There are some really astounding scenes in this season, like when White strangles a meth dealer in a basement, and a confrontation with another meth dealer named Tuco, who has screwed over his partner and his former student (well played by Aaron Paul, who is just as good as Bryan is).  Needless to say, White doesn't take it lying down.There are some overly coincidental happenings that occur too easily, and a gratuitous scene with a bathtub that is visceral but unnecessary, but the series (so far) has been intense and immensely watchable.  Do yourself a favor.  Watch this show.  It won't let you down.  It's as good as everyone says it is.

  Walter White is a man on the edge.  A former chemistry whiz, now he's an unappreciated high school teacher who moonlights as a car wash attendant.  When his doctor tells him he has terminal cancer, he decides it's time to rethink his life.  The path he chooses is unconventional and inadvisable and highly illegal, but it does break him free from his doldrums while creating all kids of problems for himself and his family.It's a wild ride, but the emotions ring true.  Walter has to deal with doctors, drug dealers, his DEA brother-in-law, a strung out former failed student and current partner, a worried wife and son, and struggles to stay alive in the face of danger while he slowly dies.  What grounds the story is the real emotional conflict of a man facing ""mid-life crisis"" on the brink of an impending death, and the issues this raises for him, his wife and his son.The performances are quite strong, especially that of Bryan Cranston, who immerses himself so thoroughly into the role of Walter White that it's hard to imagine him as anything else.  The story is engaging and unpredictable.  It looks great, and I like that they made the Albuquerque skies and deserts such an integral part of the look.  It's a strong series, that I hadn't even heard of until I tried it on this dvd set.  I'm glad I did.  While series like

  AMC's Breaking Bad is a terrific show, that has won an unprecedented number of awards, but it's one that is extremely difficult to get into. The show is centered on High School chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who discovers he's dying from cancer. Determined not to leave his family with nothing, White teams up with his former student and local drug dealer, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) in an attempt to process and sell crystal meth. Producing the drug isn't the hard part, it's distributing it while staying out of trouble. That's easier said than done, especially when your wife is on your case 24/7, and your brother in-law is a DEA agent.This show is terrific and worth every second I've spent watching it, but I almost missed out. The pilot episode was not a strong one, in fact, many fans of the show have called it the worst episode of the entire series. If you can make it passed that, the first season isn't much better. The first season is extremely dark and depressing, focusing mainly on Walt's illness and the effect it has on his family. It really wasn't easy to watch, especially if you've like me, and have had family go through the same thing.The good news is that after the depressing 7 episode first season, the show gets much much better. The network or the producers had to have to seen the same thing that everyone saw and the attention of future episodes is centered around Walt and Jesse's growing business and the problems they have, including nosy family members, the DEA, seedy people looking for a taste, and of course rival dealers and gangs. The show really picks up in the second season and starts to evolve into the award winning crime drama it has become.Bryan Cranston plays Walt and how good is he? He has won 3 Emmy's, and has been nominated every season the show has been on. The man he plays is so complicated that you really needed the very best actor you could find to play him. Walt White is a mess of emotions, concealed within a strong persona, it's this concealment that also helps to keep his conscience at bay, most of the time.Jesse Pinkman is played by Aaron Paul who is also very good. Paul himself has been nominated for four Emmy's, winning twice, and will now and forever be required to call people bitch. Paul is a very good actor and does a great job playing a character who I find to be extremely annoying. Jesse is always managing to !@#$ thing up, he's always putting them at risk by saying stupid things and doing stupid things. To be honest with you, I don't care much for the character, but the fact that the character, as opposed to the actor, annoys me, shows how strong his performances is.Walt's family is also a main stay in the show, his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), is as strong a housewife as I have ever seen. There is nothing Skyler White won't say and she is often Walt's morale compass, albeit one that is remarkably nosy and unappreciative. His son is played by newcomer R.J. Mitte whose  handicapped angle is actually real. Mitte was born with cerebral palsy, which effects his speech and movements. He admits that he over-dramatizes the effects for the show, but he is still handicapped in real life and one hell of an inspirational person. Through it all he has never let anyone tell him he can't do anything and he has been open and upfront about his condition to anyone who has asked him about it. He's really an inspiration kid, who took a handicapped and used it to his advantage.Finally, Walt's brother-in-law, DEA Agent, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), brings much needed comic relief to a show that can be hard to watch sometimes. Besides being a great cop, Schrader has a personality that is larger than life. Even in the context of a show, where the cops are the bad guys, you find yourself drawn to Schrader and rooting him on.Breaking Bad has won a total of 7 Emmy Awards and is one of the highest rated shows in cable history. The show most defiantly fits into the category of addictive television, but unlike it's neighboring show, The Walking Dead. The acting is as believable as it gets and the story just gets better and better every season. If you can make it through the slow and depressing first season, you will find an unbelievable show that may very well be one of the best that cable has ever seen.

  Why do I hate Breaking Bad?  The acting is excellent, direction good ...  but the plot is alternatively terrifying and relentlessly depressing.  Strange, the things we Americans find ""entertaining.""

  Easily the best piece of long form story telling that I've ever scene. Every single department on this show is top notch. The acting, writing, directing, cinematography, editing, music, props, etc are absolutely stellar. There is nothing that I've seen so far that is even a close second. It is definitely an emotional roller coaster so be prepared for that, but I can't recommend anything at all as highly as this.

  It's been said a lot on the reviews for Breaking Bad that this is another beautiful example of The Golden Age of Television, and I'm one to agree.  First, I'm going to say that Bryan Cranston takes this role to a level rarely seen on television.  This is as far from Malcolm in the Middle as someone could go--except for the whitey-tighties.  The story is riveting, the second season, which I believe everyone should buy, or prepare to buy, is extremely brilliant, and the third is just extraordinary as well.  I found this show when a free episode was playing at the hotel as a free rental.  I watched the Pilot episode and was blown away, I watched twice more the week I spent in that cramped little room.  It was the one good thing that came from that hotel.I think we should all be thankful for DVD's and the Internet, it is because of this that television has become so great.  Back before DVD's if you missed an episode you had to hope they replayed it.  That's why there weren't showsl ike 24, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, or The Sopranos.  Now, today, if you miss an episode, there are a hundred ways you can watch it again, from the internet, to Ondemand, to a few months later when it's released on DVD.  Because of this, we got the wonderful season long story archs, with each episode advancing the story forward.  Because of the DVD and the internet, we have Breaking Bad and I am thankful for that.

  Breaking Bad breaks new ground in television. A seemingly mundane high school chemistry teacher gets lung cancer and decides to cook meth in order to leave his family enough money to live. He teams up with a former student to cook the highest grade meth ever seen. In the mean time, he's hiding from his pregnant wife, son, and DEA agent brother in law. The choices made are not the best, but given the circumstances, what was this guy supposed to do? The show is part spectacle, part morality play, part commentary on drug culture. There are some conveniences that stretch your credulity but stay with it. Worth every minute and penny.

  After I completed watching The Sopranos I was in need for a new show to watch. Multiple friends, coworkers, and family members of mine Reccomended this too me, because I'm a fan of Bryan Cranston I thought id give it a try. I ordered it on a Tuesday and it was here by Thursday! I got a chance to watch the first episode of it on Friday, I started watching the show at 7:00pm, the pilot was good, so I watched the next, the next, the next, I looked at the clock, it was 12:30am!  I watched the whole 7 episode season in one night! I just finished watching all seasons and im currently waiting for the final 8 episodes in August 2013. If you thought this seasons wasn't that good, still stick with it because each season gets more darker and better.

  I had heard several people talking about this show.  I wasn't to sure at first, it dealt with drugs, violence all the things that really don't draw me to a show. Now after watching Season 1 all I can say is wow! I really liked the show, the actors are all great and fit their parts to a tee. The direction given to the actors is great. I love that this is available to watch on cable without subscribing to some movie channel, I will be picking up Season 2 shortly to get all caught up.On the downside one of the shows in Season 1 did drag a little, I think it was episode 4 somewhere in the middle, but it was necessary to tell the story. Don't be afraid of the drug theme of this show, it doesn't all have to do with that, so much more is involved.

  I first heard about this series in 2011. I watched the Pilot and then immediately watched every episode of every season available. Then waited impatiently for Season 5 to air.Breaking Bad breaks the mold for television shows, taking TV to a new dimension in creativity with writing, acting, directing -- everything connected with an idea becoming a show. It's not an evening soap; it's closer to reading a great novel, only I don't have to find my glasses first.  It's more intense, compelling and entertaining than a well-written book.  Often I'll read a book more than once, but I see or hear something new each time I re-view episodes of this show.I've now watched Breaking Bad, from Pilot to the last episode available, at least four times and probably more.The only thing I don't like?  After the next season, the show ends. Can't say enough good about Breaking Bad, from the title and premise to the acting and the actors' love for their work on it -- but no spoilers here. If you think you can guess what happens next, you're wrong unless you answer, ""The unexpected.""  Yet the quality of Breaking Bad makes suspension of disbelief possible, taking me places I didn't think any fiction work could get me to go.Thanks, Breaking Bad, for breaking TV's tired formulas, lifting the bar and demonstrating what's possible when an entire team (including the cable network, AMC) commit to excellence in their work.

  I am almost 60 years old and outside of The Twilight Zone - Breaking Bad is the BEST television show ever.  I did not like it during the first season, after seeing a couple episodes, because it dealt with drugs.  I abhor drugs.  But now that I've caught up, I realize how brilliant it is.  Read other reviewers if you want the storyline.  I liked Sopranos, Deadwood, Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire, Top of the Lake, and Copper but they are X rated.  I LOVED with all of my heart LOST, X Files, Twin Peaks, Star Trek, I Claudius, Uptown, Downtown, The Outer Limits because they were innovative, clever and not X rated.  This old prude is a convert to Breaking Bad. I LOVE it! It is intelligent and thoughtful.  It is July, 2013 and I'm left with Tommy James and the Shondells ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" (a song really about God's light and the crystal blue Earth we saw photographed from Apollo ships) and Mickey Dolenz's ""I'm Going' Down"" spinning in my head. I'm anxiously, and sadly, awaiting the final season.  Like LOST, Twilight Zone, Star Trek, and Mad Men, you will want to watch each episode a few times. The carefully chosen 7-word sentences and incredible acting by Walter White, Jesse, Mike, and Hank will have you hooked.  Just buy the whole series, already!

  I've been watching this through Netflix, so I didn't get any of the censoring.  I can only watch so many episodes at a time because I usually watch it on my iPad before going to sleep & it gets pretty dark with the creepy characters and periodic violence. The stuff that can stimulate nightmares because my brain grabs images like a puppy with a toy.  I'll watch a couple of episodes then switch to a comedy for a nightcap.  But it is, as someone else said, ""dangerously addicting.""  The juxtaposition of his two personas (personae?) is incredibly well played, and it's full of surprises.  I love/hate it like a bad habit.

  Captivating drama/ comedy with Bryan Cranston as a very believable man caught in more than one crisis.Others have reviewed it already so I will list my favorite scenes:1) The bathtub2) The arm scene at the junkyard3) First meeting with Tuco4) Buying the pants5) ""Ken Wins"" BMW at Danny's Gas Station6) Showing Jesse's house7) Piecing together the broken plate8) Poker Game9) Chemistry class.I don't think I'll ever forget any of those scenes!Watch the extra on Season 1 disc 3--there is plenty there. ""Taco Cabeza""--too funny! Is there really such a place?

  Walter White's (Bryan Cranston) life is not what he expected nor wanted. A mild mannered high school chemistry teacher, he just turns 50 as the show starts. His wife is expecting another child, his first some is a well adjusted 16 year old with cp and life for Walter is just, well boring.Walter's job doesn't hold the glamour for him that it did when he began. After years of teaching (or at least trying to teach) kids chemistry and trying to pass along his passion for this knowledge, he now faces a generation that more so than the rest just doesn't care or take an interest. His second job working at a car wash results in an extra income but more degradation as the owner routinely disrespects him and has him do menial jobs.The worst finally comes around when Walter collapses at the car wash and is rushed to the hospital. Not informing his family, Walter is told by the doctors there that he has terminal, inoperable lung cancer. Where does one go when their entire world collapses around them?For Walter it comes in the form of his brother-in-law, a tough talking jovial DEA agent named Hank (Dean Norris). Cajoled by Hank time and again, he takes him up on his offer to go on a ride along when then next meth lab bust takes place. There is method to Walter's madness here. He wants to get a glimpse of the set up being used with plans of making meth on his own to sell and make a fortune that he can then leave his family. Fate steps in as Walter sees a young man escape from the house next door and recognizes him as Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), an ex-student of his.Walter tracks down Jesse and offers him a proposition. He wants to be the chemist involved in making the meth that Jesse would then in turn distribute. A straight business deal that would yield them both a nice wad of cash. To do so they need a place to cook and with the DEA seeking out houses being used, Walter comes up with a plan. A Winnebago, a meth lab on wheels.They get set up, make their first batch and Jesse is stunned by the purity of the product. Walter gets in a poke at Jesse concerning his ability to listen and learn, something he didn't seem to do in high school. Had he done so in chemistry class, he would have learned the tools he needed to become a major drug provider.So here we have the set up. This is a true anti-hero if there ever was one. A mild mannered suburbanite turned into a major drug dealer? Yes this is the basis for the series. But don't misunderstand. It doesn't glorify the drug culture or Walter's decision to create drugs. The story more involves Walter's attempt to do a good deed in providing for his family but at the same time making decisions that place himself and them in jeopardy. It's more about living with your wrong decisions and watching as Walter and Jesse attempt to save themselves from the decisions they made.As the series progresses (only 7 episodes) we watch as Walter comes to life. Perhaps it's the sense of danger, perhaps the fact that he is living outside of his comfort zone or perhaps it's that he is facing death by cancer that has made Walter change. We see him move from mild mannered chemistry teacher to a man willing to walk into the home base of a wild and jacked up drug dealer to demand respect and money.But the series isn't just about that. It's also about his wife and her love of her husband as she tries to understand his change, not knowing until halfway through the series that he has cancer. It's about his son dealing not only with his own problems but with a father he loves but hasn't quite learned to respect. It's about a man driven so far to the edge that he gets involved with drug manufacturing even though his brother-in-law is a DEA agent. It's about a man who when faced with what he feels are no options, turns to the darkest part of his soul. It's about life as we probably all wish we never have to experience.The series is not just a hard edged drama though. Throughout the escapades of Walter and Jesse we get plenty of actual laughs. Whether it's Walter standing in the middle of a road in his tighty whiteys with a gun he doesn't know how to use or Walter grabbing his wife's thigh in the midst of a PTA meeting, there are some truly funny moments.When I first heard of this show it didn't interest me, it didn't sound like something I'd like. The more I watched it on DVD though, the more invested in these characters I became. I liked Walter but not what he did. I felt for Jesse but wished he seek treatment. And I hoped that this family would find a way to survive everything that happened to them.It might not be the cup of tea that the average renter would enjoy. But the dark humor, the danger and the interest in the main character make this compelling viewing as it progresses. Cranston and Paul do a fantastic job as an odd couple for the current state of affairs. And once the series ends, you find yourself looking forward to season two (coming out on DVD soon as well as season 3 starting on AMC in March 2010).One thing that has to be mentioned again about this series. It's the story of a man who produces crystal meth. It would be easy to write the series off as an homage to meth dealers and manufacturers. But that isn't at its root what the story is about. It's about a man who makes the wrong decisions for the right reasons and then has to face the consequences. Movie makers have made films about bad guys doing bad things for years and yet we've found ourselves both enjoying the films and rooting at times for the bad guys (think BONNIE AND CLYE, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and possibly even Hannibal Lecter when he snacked on characters we learned to hate).My biggest fear with this series is that it will become the norm. With series like WEEDS where a recently widowed mother becomes a major marijuana dealer or DEXTER where a serial killer becomes a hero for killing bad guys and other serial killers, a trend seems to be starting. And with Hollywood being a place that loves to imitate or repeat past successes with poor quality knock offs, this could turn out to be just the first of many shows like this. Let's just hope that they know it's good and don't move forward with plans on shows about loveable hit men, goofy corrupt politicians or silly next door neighbor pedophiles.

  Bryan Cranston as Walter White has won three consective Emmy awards for his leading role on AMC's ""Breaking Bad,"" and with good reason. Cranston's unwaveringly realistic portrayal of an ordinary High School chemistry teacher turned rogue meth dealer would make anyone take notice. He plays an incredibly intelligent chemist, who, through a series of events, gets ""stuck"" teaching high school kids rather than moving on to bigger and better things. This all changes, however, when Walt is diagnosed with terminal cancer and decides that in order to pay for his incredibly expensive chemotherapy, he's going to use his chemistry skills to produce unprecedentedly pure methamphetamine. He reconnects with a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) who has drug world connections, and the misadventures that ensue keep you absolutely at the edge of your seat. After just the gripping opening scene of episode one, I knew this show was unlike anything I'd ever seen before. It's hard to not watch an entire season in one sitting because of the show's outstanding cinemetography, extraordinary direction, out-of-this world acting by all actors involved (Dean Norris is a perfect addition as Hank, Walt's good-guy bad-guy DEA Agent brother-in-law) and phenomenal writing and storylines. This show is definitely for adults only; graphic sex scenes and rated R-type violence riddle each episode, but those who are old enough to watch it are lucky. In my opinion, this is hands-down the best show on television. Addicting, well-thought out TV gold. -Sagel Friendsmith

  While this seasons point was 2 create the setting for the later seasons that followed (which are also all really great!) and also 2 give you a first glimpse at the characters that would radically change over the course of a few seasons. Walter White is a chemistry teacher who is dealt a very dreadful hand, CANCER! And now with limited time on Earth he comes up with a scheme 2 support his family and even his grandchilderen for future family generations! Cook some meth! This season really opened the door too this great show and sort of dispalyed what these characters were all like before they really broke bad! ;)

  When not re-airing 50-year-old westerns or atrocious horror-movie sequels, AMC has managed to emerge as a leading purveyor of quality TV over the past few years, and Breaking Bad stands with Mad Men as the leading examples of the channel's evolution.  Its portrait of Walter White, a cancer-stricken Albuquerque high-school chemistry teacher who enters the meth business with a former student to provide for his family, provides one of the more outlandish premises currently on TV, but in a world laden with crime procedurals and reality shows it's a huge gift for the discriminating viewer.  Even as events become more sensationalistic in the season's later going, the exacting realism of its setting, the emphasis on the characters, and especially Bryan Cranston's compelling performance as Walt keep the proceedings grounded in reality.  Anyone who enjoyed Cranston's work as the perpetually nervous father on Malcolm in the Middle is in for a real treat here, as he expands on his old signature role with a genuinely ambiguous, darkly funny performance that makes you feel for Walt even as he engages in some inexplicable and occasionally reprehensible acts.  Playing a character who moves over the course of seven episodes from a repressed middle-aged teacher to a swaggering outlaw, Cranston has to project rectitude, alienation, boredom, secrecy, and stubornness in equal measure, and he manages to pull off this balancing act perfectly.When the show begins, Walt's life is pretty much the epitome of suburban normalcy and sterility, almost to the point of parody, from his faux-adobe house to his crossover utility vehicle to his unfulfilling job and predictable family life.  Walt himself pretty much couldn't be more ordinary--even after he's learned about his illness and made the move into the criminal world, Walt's still the kind of guy who, when faced with having to kill a rival, makes a list of pros and cons before taking action.  At the same time, we see the liberating effects that having nothing to lose to start to have on Walt--after all, when you're dying of cancer, it's a lot easier to justify cooking meth, or confronting some jock types making fun of your handicapped son, or blowing up the car of a bluetooth-wearing yuppie d-bag who's stolen your parking spot.  The show wisely avoids passing judgement on Walt or his activities, instead focusing on Walt's motivations and his attempts to negotiate a completely unfamiliar world while concealing his illegal doings from his mildly suspicious wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and his son Walt Jr. (RJ Mitte).  Complicating Walt's life even further, his alpha-male DEA agent brother-in-law Hank starts investigating some of the events surrounding the local meth scene, making Walt's family life uncomfortably entangled with his new profession and adding a whole new layer of tension  and dramatic irony to the show.  As Hank, Dean Norris puts in some of the best work of the season--it would be easy to make him little more than a meatheaded foil for Walt, but Hank emerges as someone very real, who does legitimately believe in what he does for a living.Similarly, as Walt's former student turned partner-in-crime Jesse Pinkman, Aaron Paul initially appears to be little more than a stereotypical white homey type, but Paul eventually manages to turn him into a worthy complement to the more naïve and less seasoned Walt (it helps that he gets a highly disproportionate share of the season's funniest lines).  I especially enjoyed the way the two leads start to rub off on each other as the season goes on, with Walt becoming more comfortable with his illegal activities and Jesse starting to adopt his partner's strict standards of quality.  From the initial formation of Walt and Jesse's uneasy partnership in the first episode, the show manages to wring a great deal of humor and drama (not to mention several unforgettable scenes) from the spectacle of two inexperienced criminals trying to improvise their way along as they find themselves increasingly in over their heads.  The last two episodes of the season are especially strong, with Walt trying to move himself and Jesse deeper into the criminal underworld and becoming increasingly bold and fearless in the process, even if it means doing business with memorably psychotic Mexican gang leader Tuco (Raymond Cruz, in an enjoyably over-the-top performance).Overall, it's pretty hard to find anything critical to say of this show.  Even at a mere seven episodes, the first season of Breaking Bad manages to generate more intrigue, emotion, and classic imagery than most shows manage in their entire existence.  Thus far the second season has been even better, so the show clearly hasn't long any of its edge.  If you're looking for something more rewarding than CSI: Topeka or the latest unbearably drawn-out season of American Idol, you can do a lot worse for an alternative than Breaking Bad.

  I've never been so drawn in to a tv show before.  It took a couple of episodes for it to happen.  About halfway through the first season I was sitting on the edge of my seat, couldn't wait to see what happens next.  But that never stopped.  They managed to make every episode for four straight seasons build up so slowly but consistently.  Every episode left me thinking ""it's over now, either his family will find out, the DEA will bust him, the cartel will murder him"" and he makes it through these situations, but in a believable way.

  I have watched this show from Day 1.  All I can say is what I said in my Title.  ""This is the Greatest Drama in TV History.""  5 Stars is not enough.  Yes, some of the show is difficult to watch because of content but it is realistic in so many ways.  The details on the show are unbelievable.  The littlest item cannot be overlooked and the writers use those details to the best of their abilities.  This is a series that needs to be watched several times from the beginning to catch the little details you may have missed and come back to haunt Walt, Jessie, Hank and others later in the series.  As said I have watched on AMC from beginning then rewatched with my wife the second time on Netflix in HD who got hooked.  Now I am going to get all of the series on Blu-Ray shortly so can rewatch a third time to catch things I missed in preparation for the end in 2013.  Man!! I am going to miss this show but cannot wait another year but have to.  At least I can look at the DVD again to get ready!!  All I can do is speculate what is going t happen but with Vince Gilligan that is near impossible. Cannot Recommend this series enough!!!!!!!!!!!!

  This is an amazing, almost-plausible, intense and refreshing series that I never thought I'd enjoy this much. But be forewarned: Start from the pilot episode to learn about each character, or you'll be lost and out-of-touch with them, and the story (which I feel is much more engaging than even ""Lost""). If anyone ever spoils the episodes, punch them in the shoulder! I feel such wide-ranging emotions for the characters, and each new one that enters displays a great deal of talent. Everyone talks about the cinematography, and it is top-notch. The angles, composition and thought process of style is terrific and better than anything I've seen. One thing I truly admire is how the writing doesn't make it seem like some kind of glorified soap opera. While the emotions run high and plot truly thickens, the performers act in a drama that's based on the real-life drug world where this series - and life - imitate each other. You'll feel like you're watching a train wreck, but without the lame Bruckheimer-style production: when things play out, expect that natural sound is what you hear, not some kind of theatrical swell of an orchestra to ""enhance"" the drama. A shootout in season three is what completely blew me away. Realistic sounds of gunfire shattered the quiet tension that made my jaw drop in amazement.The realism seems to be what the crew want you to experience. They try to immerse the viewer into a plausible world of what one over-qualified chemist, Walter White (magnificently played by Bryan Cranston), working as an underpaid high school teacher, chooses when diagnosed with terminal cancer. He exploits his knowledge of chemistry to make quick cash and lots of cheddar by manufacturing a pristine crystal methamphetamine to provide a nest egg for his family and unborn child before he succumbs. But Walt's choices result in some dire consequences that grow more gloomy and dire as he continues to manufacture, forsaking those consequences - and everyone around him - to provide for his family by any means necessary. His blind ambition results in mounting collateral damages and human and emotional tragedies. The talents on screen were trained well in their field by experts off-screen. The police truly act like law enforcement, while drug users and pushers seemed all-too-authentic in front of the camera. Some bit actors even resembled real-life drug addicts. It's a well-scripted, thorough work whose story lines are intertwined thoughtfully. And yet there's always a character that provides some comic relief to keep the story from becoming too bleak. The only bone I can pick at, is that Walt hasn't switched from briefs to boxers as his character's mild manner transformed to a take-charge attitude.

  ...however, I stuck with it and by the second season my wife and I were addicts and watched then entire series with three episodes a night (thanks to Blockbuster going belly up and selling out their stock on the cheap!). While there is an occasional clunker (the BUG episode has to be a joke from the writer to see if his fans were so rabin that they were willing to ""watch pain dry"" for an hour), overall the entire series is fantastic.

  What a great dame story! I mean this show had everything. If your looking for a good show to watch then look no more.if your a man and have a family then u will like it even more.

  This is an incredible show.  Bryan Cranston is simply awesome as a very smart man who never really tapped into his own potential until he had nothing to lose.  Faced with impending oblivion, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) feels the urgency of time that we should ALL feel, but so rarely do.  Walter is actually a brilliant man who has just not either had the breaks or ambition to climb above the mediocrity that surrounds him - until he is confronted with his own early demise.  As a man who truly loves his family, Walter realizes that he needs to make a lot of money FAST before he dies, so that he won't leave his family destitute.  He then pursues with single-minded determination the only avenue available to a ""little"" man with no resources or powerful friends - drug sales.  Realizing that his prowess as a chemist FAR outstrips the abilities of the typical losers who synthesize meth as a living, Walter sets out to become a meth ""cooker.""  However, true to form, he does so honestly, at least in the way that he insists that proper procedures be used to make the best product possible, and then to sell it at a fair price!  The contradiction of an ""honest"" meth cooker is incredibly well played by Cranston.  Throw in the other factors that would accompany such an outlandish (and yet, believable) plot, and you get a very compelling story that is accessible to a lot of main-stream America.

  Great story line - Extremely talented and well played roles - Not just a step away from the Norm...but a HUGE leap!!...You may read the description and think that this would not appeal to you - This series shows what little it could take to make somebody change in an instance - If you watch Season 1 Episode 1 you'll want to see the next one right away!!...if you watch the Season 1 Episode 2 then you'll be hooked (its dark suspense at its best!!!)...normally I write more on reviews but if you have not seen this yet you must get a taste...Amazon offers Episode 1 of all seasons for free to so you have nothing to lose...enjoy your new addiction :)

  Why oh why only seven episodes?  This is a great and addictive series that leaves you hungry for more. Ah, but maybe that's the idea.  Bryan Cranston is absolutely fearless as the cancer stricken high school chem teacher who has a lovely wife, a bright disabled son, and a daughter on the way.  He's also got a brother in law who is in law enforcement, and a talent for cooking meth that makes him a legend in Albuquerque.  Meth means money, and money means the best in chemo and other treatments.  Of course, it also means dangerous company, accidents and other physical dangers, and lots of pressure to produce more meth.minor spoiler below.....Cranston is also heartbreakingly good in the intervention scene, in which he at first lays out his case for not wanting to be sickened by the treatments...before he changes his mind.Very strong episodes.

  This show was one I put off watching and now I wonder why the heck I did that. It sucked me in from the first episode and before I knew it, I was ready for the second season. For those who enjoy gritty drama and the awkwardness of life and dealing with the ones you love, this show is for you. It offers a window into a world not seen by most middle class Americans and those not touched by cancer or drug addiction.Incredible and worth my time to watch (and that is saying something).

  Wanna watch a series about a guy that cooks and sells ""meth""?No, not really? Me neither.The idea of romanticizing something like ""meth"" just didn't do anything for me personally. After multiple friends raved about it to me, I ""broke"" down and gave it two episodes to hook me or not. As it turns out, two was more than needed.Despite the seedy backdrop of the series, its still very human, and relevant to modern social situation. Having taken a page from British TV, the cast is comprised of everyday schmos that most people can relate to, and that's what makes this show as entertaining as it is.The plots of the main and sub story are predictably tangled, yet somehow I kept watching and thinking to myself, ""Ok, now what are you going to do Walter?""I recommend!

  Writing, directing, editing, photography, and especially acting all superb in the series about a high school chemistry teacher whose 40-year old wife is 7 months pregnant with a surprise baby, whose 16-year old son has cerebral palsy, and who has just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.  What happens when someone like that is told he has 18 months to live?Well, Walt goes on a ridealong with his DEA brother-in-law to bust a meth lab, and as the bust is going down, sees what was inarguably his worst student ever climbing out of the window of the house next door, where the ex-student been screwing the neighbor while his meth cooks.  Later, his ex-student answers a knock at the door.  It's Walt, who says, ""Let's cook.""And that, folks, is just the first episode.  The series is an amazing exploration into the morally liberating effect having no hope can have on the human psyche, an almost documentary look at a slow, incremental descent into evil, and a cautionary note on the violence that can lurk beneath the surface of what appears to be the mildest of men. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are perfect foils. This may be the best buddy series ever.

  This is a tv series that I think airs on amc on cable. I had never heard of this series before and watched on a recommendation from a friend. From the very first scene of the first episode I was hooked on the series. The first episode is full of action and a very intriguing introduction to the series. The main character is diagnosed with cancer and begins an unusual path as a result. The show has endless possibilities where they can take the story line I can't wait to see! Be warned though it has some pretty graphic subject matter and violence at times. I'm pretty sure there is content in the complete season release that would not have made it to cable, although cable is pretty liberal lately. Anyway, this is defiantly a guilty pleasure that is addicting as it is controversial and I have already ordered the next season in anticipation of what will happen next.

  I took the supreme gamble when I first got this DVD set.  I bought it, sight unseen, from the recommendations of a few sources.  Pretty much every reviewer I read raved about the series, but never gave any indication as to what is was about or why it was good.  While you may know now that the story is about a brilliant chemist who is diagnosed with inoperable cancer who makes a horrible decision to cook crystal meth in a one-time deal to leave a nest-egg for his family.  But that does not encapsulate why this is such a great show.  The show is so great because it is the consequences of one incredibly bad decision.  The lies and bad actions multiply as he lies to the cops and his family and he morphs into a criminal figure; something he had no intended but can't escape.Blah, blah, blah.  That is the basic story, but what is so great about this story is how it changes tone throughout the story.  What starts off as a basic drama then becomes a comedy of the blackest sort.  But around the 6th or 7th show, it drastically takes a turn into danger.  The people who work with him become increasingly psychotic, unpredictable and dangerous.  The show then says to us, ""We're not messing around here anymore.  These are dangerous people and dangerous situations.""  Check out this series, it is one of the best on TV that is not on HBO.  You will not be disappointed.

  ""Breaking Bad"" is a short 7-episode series aired by (surprisingly) American Movie Classics.  While a team effort, this series was created by Vince Gilligan and stars Bryan Cranston (the dear not-so-old dad from ""Malcom in the Middle"") as the desperate, cancer-ridden chemistry teacher, Walter White.The pilot episode gives us what appears to be a basic plot - a good guy, White, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  Strapped with poor insurance and a teacher's salary, he turns to a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to sell drugs to pay for his treatment.  So far, if this sounds like a retread of Michael Douglas's character in ""Falling Down,"" you wouldn't be far off.But then it turns out that Walter is more than meets the eye.  Sure, his family doesn't really respect him - his brother-in-law is a DEA agent and is shocked to hear that wallflower Walt would even consider smoking a joint.  It turns out that Walter is a genius when it comes to chemistry, and his sidekick Jesse is shocked to discover that in one afternoon Walter cranks out crystal meth of such purity as the local market has never seen before. Indeed, the DEA discovers a sample of the product and is convinced that a new drug kingpin has arrived in town.All of this is told in gradual steps - we see brief flashbacks of Walter at CalTech lecturing to a beautiful grad student while simultaneously seducing her, only to later learn that she is married to Walter's former best friend and classmate who has made millions patenting chemicals that he and Walter worked on together.  Exactly why Walter is teaching indifferent high school students when he is so gifted is never explained, but thanks to Cranston's steller performance and some wonderful writing we see that Walter is a proud, conflicted, flawed man who has made some hard choices but never blames anyone for his failures.And his failures are many.  Walter is the only guy left in America driving a Pontiac Aztec, for pete's sake!  His marriage has fallen into tedium, and his wife tries to squeak a few pennies out of selling junk on EBay.  Walter is not really close to anyone, and did I forget to mention the terminal lung cancer?Watching Walter emerge from his stifled teacher existence as he fights to raise the heaping gobs of money for his cancer treatment while keeping his wife in the dark is a pure joy.  Liberated by his terminal status, Walter has never been more alive.This is an excellent series, if a bit short at 7 episodes.  Here's looking forward to Season 2.  Also, even though this is a product of ""basic cable"" on AMC, there is a spot of nudity and some rather prolific swearing, so don't be fooled into thinking this is something that has been sanitized for network TV - this is hard-core stuff.

  Near the end of the first season of Vince Gilligan's AMC drama ""Breaking Bad"", Walter White (played by the underrated Bryan Cranston) is offered a Cuban cigar. Despite suffering from life-threatening lung cancer, he takes the opportunity to enjoy the taste of this ""imported"" item. This leads directly into a conversation with Hank, his brother-in-law and a DEA agent, about the validity of illegal drugs. Walter uses prohibition as his example, observing that one day there were people on the streets breaking barrels open into the gutters, the next day; it became a staple to this country. Hank fires back that harder drugs (like cocaine or meth) could be a greater detriment to society than liquor [or even Walt's supposed addiction to pot]. In this short three minute scene, the entire thesis statement for ""Breaking Bad"" is questioned. Is smoking an illegal Cuban cigar any different than becoming a meth chemist? ""Breaking Bad"" takes this grey line and pushes the envelope further. Walter White is not a bad guy. He isn't a dead-beat dad fighting bills and a troubling home life, but instead merely a scientific man who has been handed a difficult question. How do you make sure that you can provide for your family even after you have died?The answer in ""Breaking Bad"" is to cook meth, to break the law for the sake of the common good - to break the law because you want to protect your family. Despite the common architecture of this story found in several films and television series, ""Breaking Bad"" feels unique and compelling due to organic-real acting and Gilligan's detailed writing. Discounting the wobbly feeling of the first episode, ""Breaking Bad"" picks up pace with its second episode entitled Cats In the Bag... in which Walter and his meth-counterpart Jesse must decide what to do with two bodies in their RV, one living and one dead. Imagining that this was merely going to be a gritty series chronicling the unexpected rise of meth developers, my mindset quickly changed when Gilligan slowed down, and introduced us calmly to his lead, Walter White. Dressed in beige and driving a white Pontiac Aztek; Walter resembles the man next door, with a simple wife and a son who suffers from cerebral palsy, his life is not riddled with chaos numbers or symbolic ducks in the pool, his only crime is being a statistic in middle class America. With flashbacks of his prior life before becoming a teacher, a small glimpse into the future he could have had (with Grey Matter), and the horrors of modern medicine ($5000 merely for the initial consultation), Gilligan doesn't make ""Breaking Bad"" into a story about the drugs. It is a story about Walter, and about choice. It is about the choice to fight cancer, the choice to let Crazy 8 go, it is about rediscovering one's self amongst the rubble. While Gilligan paints Walt's family well, at this point in the season they are merely there for dramatic effect. It is Walt that we are following, it is his cough that we feel each episode, and it is his humble nature that we applaud when the credits roll.""Breaking Bad"" understood its limitations in its initial season. This isn't a series about immediate gratification, but instead about the long story. It isn't a television series that tries to make you ""gasp"" around each turn. This is a character development story. While each episode contained elements that were compelling to the story, it is Walt's transformation/personality that pulls you back to another episode. How? See: Cranston's ability to make Walter White more than just a money hungry drug maker, but a family man struggling to keep it together. One of my favorite episodes came early, when Walt had a diabolical run in with a man merely known as KEN WINS (located in episode Cancer Man). This demonstrated to me (better than the long dialog between Cranston and Crazy 8) what Walter White was capable of, and what I should expect in the episodes/seasons to come.Finally, ""Breaking Bad"" has a message. It has something to say about healthcare in our society, it has something to say about casual drugs in America, and it has something to say about family values. I began this review with a detailed scene between Hank and Walt (whose words still haunt me), but an even stronger analogy of the ""Breaking Bad"" core message can be seen in the episode A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal in which another equally bad crime questions the value of family. This is the type of writing that is missed in modern television, ""The Sopranos"" tried it but it became too muddied nearer to the end, and ""Deadwood"" became too visually heavy. ""Breaking Bad"" takes those lacking elements and chemically creates a stronger series. It takes modern working-man concerns, and allows Walter White to do what he does best - survive. With the tilt of his black hat in the junkyard, he best represents what many of us face daily - fear.

  One of the best seasons of television I've ever seen for any show. Bryan Cranston's character is all at once endearing, lovable, nerdly, tortured, and troubling as he tests whether 'the ends' really do 'justify the means'.It's not for everyone and not family entertainment certainly, but I don't feel the writing is made to strictly entice (which admittedly it does) but to make you think and reflect on our own thoughts in actions in less than ideal situations.Unfortunately season 1 was cut off with the writers strike so it's only 6 episodes, still was enough to make me hungry for more.

  It seems that the tragic hero is making a comeback, particularly in the realm of television. These characters are no more victims of fate than they are of their own actions, their greed, their mistakes. These characters live and breathe so many shades of grey we don't know whether we should be rooting for their triumph or eagerly awaiting their inevitable downfall. We love the character, but we hate ourselves for loving such an amoral being. It's confusing, it's morally uncomfortable, but it's a whole lot of fun.Enter Bryan Cranston's brilliant portrayal of Walter White, the latest entry in the tragic hero tradition. Walter is a high school Chemistry teacher who is in dire financial straits. Walter's wife is pregnant, his son is handicapped, and Walter himself has just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and learned he has little time to live, and a fortune in medical bills that insurance won't cover. What's a man to do? Well, if you're Walter White, you use your chemistry expertise to get involved in the crystal meth business, in the hopes that when you leave this world, you leave behind some money to make sure your family is taken care of.Preposterous? Sure. But it works, largely thanks to Cranston's stellar performance as White (which has earned him Best Actor Emmy wins for both of the show's seasons so far). Walter is a mess of a man--on one hand, he's the ultimate family man, doing whatever he can to hold his family together and make sure they can survive financially once he dies. On the other hand, he's being insanely selfish, putting at risk the lives of himself and his family and supporting what an extremely harmful underground drug trade. Cranston handles the role with great finesse, moving seamlessly from moments of despair as we watch a man dealing with the devastation of cancer, to moments of hilarity as we watch Walter cluelessly try to establish himself as a player in the drug business.The first season of ""Breaking Bad"" clocks in at only 7 episodes, and is a great introduction to the show's zany, darkly comic world. The story flows smoothly, playing more like an extended movie than a television show, and makes for great TV on DVD. The show is not without its flaws--the story of Walter and his family is consistently compelling, but some of the side stories are not, and not all of the acting is as strong as Cranston's. In particular, Jesse, Walter's high-school dropout partner-in-crime, doesn't always rise to the bar set by Cranston, and his side stories at times leave you wanting only to get back to Walter's plot, but he also provides a comic foil to Walter's stoic seriousness and is an important inclusion to the show.All in all, the first season of ""Breaking Bad"" is a wild ride featuring an outstanding lead performance and a dark, compelling story that carefully balances the poignant and the inane. What a refreshingly different series that ends with nothing but great promise for future seasons to come.

  I saw the trailers and I thought this show looked uninteresting. Then, probably around midseason, there was a mini-marathon on AMC, and I caught all the first few episodes. Instantly hooked. Finished the entire season, under the spell and alure of this show. It's light years better than anything else on tv. You can have your Nip/Tuck, your Grey's Anatomy your lame crime drama shows and all that other mindless garbage on television, this show is the real deal.The characters are all played exceptionally well...Bryan Cranston deserved the emmy he received for his dramatic role of Walter White, the conservative family man who takes on an entire new edge to better the means of his family. I'm not going to go too into the plot in this review, instead I'd rather just examine what I like about it and the high points of the show.The remainder of the supporting cast is fantastic. I believe compelling dynamics existing between the characters is a lost art in modern day television. This show is rock solid in delivering those dynamics. For example, the relationship with Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) seems simple on the surface, but is often prone to more complex layers. This is very evident in their simple conversations and interactions, such as when they formulate plans or deal with conflicts. One of the more truly defining moments in their relationship occurs when White visits Pinkman in the hospital after Pinkmans' initial meeting with Tuco, sociopathic drug kingpin.It should also be noted that there is also a little something extra and special to be found in the series, as the actor that plays White's son is not only meant to have cerebral palsy for his character, but the actor himself truly does have cerebral palsy. For this, I commend the actor, Mittes, for his bravery and talent. Definitely a favorite moment of mine is when White and his wife notice some mean-spirited high schoolers mocking his son's handicap while clothes shopping. White, who at this point is living dangerously, takes it upon himself to settle things in an aggressive manner, the opposite of what his predictable self would have done prior to his new, edgy lifestyle.The other character that truly intrigues me is Tuco, the drug kingpin with psychotic tendencies. The actor (Raymond Cruz, I believe) is extraordinary in portraying the dangerous and remorseless personality typical of a drug kingpin. The ending to the first season was brilliant, both with scripted lines and the physical acting, the restrained emotion and horror that both Pinkman and White exhibit upon witnesing the brutal beatdown. Also, it was a perfect lead-in to the the next season, leaving fanatic viewers such as myself salivating for what very well may be a rollercoaster of a next season, and sympathetic in understanding that White and Pinkman nonverbally and unemotionally express with subtle body language and nondescript facial expressions that they know they are probably in for a devestating adventure. I credit the writers and the artists behind the genius for creating an infinitely superior product.Ive never connected so well with a fictional concept. This show has definite human elements, and still manages to be exceptionally entertaining. A rare commodity. I couldn't be more excited about the dvd hitting shelves in late Feb, the second season, whenever it arrives, and utterly engrossed in something on television. Not sure how long it's going to last, but I consciously disregard that thought and enjoy something special while it lasts.Paris,

  Probably one of the best tv series ever aired. It is very hard to only watch one episode. I'm addicted. All the actors are fantastic. Walter Whites transition makes you root for the bad guy. Its neat watching Bryan Cranston go from Hal on Malcom in the Middle to Heisenburg on Breaking Bad. If you decide to watch this show, watch it from beginning to end. Not one episode is worth missing.

  Had I known how Breaking Bad would develop, I doubt I would have started watching in the first place, as I didn't think it would be my kind of thing. How wrong I could be. Each episode is a mini masterpiece, and the whole is almost perfection. It felt like the writers had a vision from the outset, and stuck with the overarching narrative that they had planned, unlike so much television, where another season is added when the first does well, and the writer's need to make it up as they go along. The storyline was superb, and the characters terrific (and well done for having a character with a disability which was incidental, not the focus). Best of all, the humanity which shone through the inhumanity, and how there are consequences to all actions, just so brilliantly done.

  I've known about Breaking Bad, but I just couldn't figure out for the life of me on why people love this show so much. I went on Netflix and watched episode 1. Wow. I can see why people like this. This is good, real good. From research I've done, Walter White has lung cancer and decides to cook meth to leave money for his family when he eventually passes away. I'm glad I gave this a chance! I'll certainly keep watching.

Its not another Weeds. Its not about drugs (if ya ask me) Its about people... Breaking Bad.Netflix has seasons 1-2-3 available but, season four (is the BEST) and its here on Amazon.

  Television can put out something of artistic value and still have a wide appeal. Life is gritty. A compelling drama should be equally so and BB meets this challenge head on and in a believable format. Who among us has not wondered about what it would be like to step out of the restraints of an honest living and go for it?  This is an addictive show as is the product portrayed by the efforts of the cast. Give it the first three episodes and you can find out what it's like on the other side without going through rehab or ending in jail.

  Not very many shows can have you rooting simultaneously for and against the lead character.Walter White has the potential to be any upstanding citizen when faced with a demon like cancer.Even though this series can be full of sex, drugs, and violence, the heart of the show is so much more.Ethical questions abound within this thought provoking series, and at the end of the day what we all knew was coming(...when you live a hard and fast lifestyle) ends up happening.My take away? This is a series worth your time.

  I've never been a fan of dramas- my favorite television shows by far are comedies. So really, what first got me started into watching Breaking Bad was finding out the main character is none other than the goofy dad from Malcom in the Middle. I just couldn't picture him in a sinister role so i watched the show more out of curiosity as to how he can portray such a different role, rather than attention to the plot or characters or whatever. I was simply blown away not just by his own acting skills, but everyone else on the show. Now when i think of Bryan Cranston, i think of walter from Breaking Bad, rather than Hal from Malcom in the Middle. What i particularly like about this series is that the writers don't feel compelled to make the actors verbalize every little action or emotion the character is feeling, but rather allow the actors to, well, act. This allows for a much more natural flow to their interactions, or even how the characters behave when alone. Most of the characters are incredibly complex and far from one-dimensional.I could go on and on about this series, but i urge you to just watch some episodes on AMC and you'll see how much truth these rave reviews have.

  It kind of pains me to not give this season 5 stars.  The reason for this really isn't about the show or anything that it does wrong, but more about the fact that they charge you for a full season when all you really get are a few episodes or half a season.  There are not many special features, and the overall presentation for the box set is lacking.  With that being said enough happens this season that you need to watch it before you go into the second season, so my recommendation is to either find it on a streaming site or watch it online.  If that is not your thing, I would definitely recommend that you start watching the show.  There are some great moments in this season, but I have to admit that I wasn't really hooked until mid way through the second season, so I definitely think you should stick with it even if this season isn't your bag, but still THE BEST SHOW OF ALL TIME persiod.  Just not the best season.

  From start to finish, this show delivers.  It's smart, well written, acted, directed, sets are perfect, etc.  All actors and actresses in the show perform to perfection.  If you like suspense, drama, comedy, and a good story, this show will provide all of that, and more.Watching Breaking Bad in HD looks amazing.  The directors of this show really like telling the story beyond the script with what is shot, and HD does it justice.  If you haven't seen this show yet, watch it in HD (blu-ray).

  ""Breaking Bad"" isn't in the same exalted ranks as ""The Sopranos"", but it's good enough and different enough to easily get five stars.Vince Gilligan, the series' creator, says it can be viewed as a comedy, and the first two episodes are blackly funny throughout. The tone is Hitchcockian, and Gilligan borrows freely from The Master, even going back as far as ""The Lodger"". I leave it to you to find the other references and takings. (The following episodes are more-fitfully funny, with the theft of the methylamine being the most-broadly humorous.)The most-obvious Hitchcockian element is having the audience thoroughly identify with the character we /aren't/ supposed to identify with -- Walter White. He didn't /need/ to cook meth -- his former business partner would have covered his medical expenses -- but he does it anyway. Gilligan enhances our sympathy for Walter by surrounding him with thoroughly unlikeable and/or stupid people * -- his sister-in-law (a shoplifter), his brother-in-law (a macho DEA cop), his drug-dealer associate (who, as they say, couldn't pour piss from a boot if the instructions were printed on the bottom), and worst of all, his wife. Skyler White (her name ""says it"") is a self-centered, judgemental, ungrateful person who's more interested in ""communicating"" with her husband than in loving and supporting him. When Walter is finally willing to tell her everything, she refuses to listen: ""I don't think I could handle it."" (What did he ever see in her? What did he ever do to deserve such an uncaring b****?) The only sympathetic major character is Walter's son, played charmingly by R J Mitte.Gilligan also borrows another Hitchcock theme -- we never /really/ know what's going through the minds of the seemingly ""good"" people we associate with. Much of ""Breaking Bad"" riffs on this theme.Gilligan has no problem appropriating scenes from famous films, such as ""GoodFellas"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"". He doesn't do this often enough to be annoying, though.The quality of acting is not particularly high. John de Lancie, an actor I normally don't much care for, gives an understated and effective performance as the father of a junkie, and Bob Odenkirk is just plain wonderful as a corrupt lawyer with high ethical standards, but most of the actors (especially Christopher Cousins) seem to have been rounded up at a garage sale, Aaron Paul being the principal exception.Bryan Cranston pretty much carries the series. The scripting is rarely less than acceptable -- but similarly hardly ever inspired. For Cranston, it doesn't need to be, because he's given many opportunities to /show/ us, with his face and body, what his character is thinking, rather than reading lines. It's a solid performance.There are surprising technical errors. An explosion strong enough to blow out windows would also likely blow out the eardrums of anyone present. And it's unlikely that two gallons of hydrofluoric acid would be enough to dissolve a human body /and/ take out the tub and the floors beneath. It's such nasty stuff that it's /highly unlikely/ gallon jugs of it would be sitting in the supply room of a high-school chemistry lab.* It took a while to figure this out. My initial reaction was that the actors were either miscast or poor actors. But the characterizations appear to be intentional.

  I watched the main actor (Bryan Cranston) win an Emmy, so I thought I would watch the first episode of the show just to see if it intrigued me. I had no clue what the show was about or what to expect. It turned out to be the best series I've watched on television (previously was 24-mainly the first couple of seasons). The acting is far beyond any tv and even most movies. Aaron Paul has improved immensely since season 1. Bryan Cranston has won the Emmy for best actor every single year since the show started-that speaks for itself in my opinion, and then Dean Norris-wow, he came out of nowhere and just blew me away. He has some amazing scenes in seasons 2 & 3 that he just blew me away in. The show is raw, gory, and brutal, but it's also all honest without being preachy. I have finished all 3 seasons and can't wait for July '11 when it comes back on air. I've shared the show with 6 other people and all have became huge fans. AMC has really got an amazing lineup with this, Mad Men, and their new Walking Dead show. The blu-ray is great and worth the couple dollars more than the DVD set, looks great in a lot of the outdoor scenes.

  People who wax philisophical about this being the Golden Age of television arent off in any way.  Never before in my life have I been around so many solidly great shows airing at once.  I'm not saying this is universal, because of course this is also the era of reality TV, but between The Wire, Dexter, Numb3rs, Lost, Californication, etc, etc, I've never before been as excited about what is possible with television as an entertainment media.  I think we have far and away trumped movies as far as overall content and originality.  Movies are all about the ""remake"" these days, but shows like Breaking Bad are about as original as you could possibly ask for.I wont really get into too much thematic elements or subject items, because I dont want to spoil one second of this extremely brief Season 1, but Bryan Cranston absolutely hits it out of the park with his portrayal of ""average middle class dad"".  He plays it so numb, then breaks bad with such force...I honestly think this is one of the performances of the year.  I'm not overstating this in any way, he's phenomenal.  He makes you so sympathetic to his plight that you really watch each episode absolutely rooting for him to best the challenging sitution he's involved in.  He's the baddest nerd that ever was.Give this show one episode, and you'll be hooked, and go ahead and set aside another six hours to marathon the rest of the series.  Its that good.

  I picked this up because my brother recommended it, and I just wish I'd known about it sooner. The story is really original and interesting, without being too fantastical (though it comes close at times). This show isn't just about cooking meth, that's just the vessel for characters and surrounding story. It's about cancer and its treatment, teaching, and most of all family drama and all it entails. The acting, especially from the lead role, is superbly done, and the script is also excellent. Being a Chemistry Major, I liked the fact that it all is done very well in the show, straying from being too simplistic while still showing a lot of depth. Someone on the show obviously knows their stuff, though I can't admit to knowing about all the procedures involved in synthesizing crystal meth.I can't wait to check out the following seasons, I can only imagine what craziness will happen. It is a little violent and gory at times, and contains controversial subjects, but no one should have that keep them from checking out this show.

  I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to get Hal out of my head from Malcolm in the Middle, but they took care of that right away.  This show is rocking fun, and just when you settle in it for the hijinx the show reminds you that the main character is dying, and is facing the loss of his family and the possibility that he won't get to watch his baby grow up.Also, the son looks just like Dean Wean.  I would give it an extra star for that if I could.

  First I want to say that this series is great and if you haven't seen it yet or are unsure about it, buying this affordable set is a great way to test it out with the first seven episodes now available in high def. If you like those episodes or if you're one of the people who already love this series then this Blu-Ray Set is for you. It contains the complete first season of AMC's Breaking Bad in seven one hour long episodes.In short the plot is a more serious Bryan Cranston than we've seen playing chemistry teacher Walter White, who gets diagnosed with cancer. With a son, Walter Jr, who is disabled and a wife, Skyler, who is pregnant with her second child in her late thirties he decides the best way to take care of his family is to start making crystal meth with one of his old dead beat students, Jesse. The further he goes to try and provide for his family the darker and more complicated his life becomes with crazy drug dealer's, increasing extended family issues with his wife's sister, Marie, and to top it off a bother in law, Hank, who is a Drug Enforcement Administration Officer.The episodes found on this set are:Ep 1: Pilot - Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer. With a new lease on life, Walter becomes a drug dealer to secure his family's financial security.Aired: 1/20/2008Ep 2: Cat's in the Bag... - Following their debacle in the desert, Walter and Jesse are left with a mess to dispose of. Later, Skyler grows suspicious of Walt's recent activity.Aired: 1/27/2008Ep 3: ...and the Bag's in the River - Walter is left to deal with Krazy-8 alone following an argument with Jesse. After Marie raises concerns that Walt Jr. is smoking cannabis, Hank shows him the dangers of drug use.Aired: 2/10/2008Ep 4: Cancer Man - The DEA becomes suspicious of a new drug kingpin. Walt reveals that he has cancer to Marie and Hank. Elsewhere, Jesse visits his estranged family.Aired: 2/17/2008Ep 5: Gray Matter - Walter and Skyler attend a former colleague's party. Jesse tries free himself from the drugs. Later, Skyler organizes an intervention for Walt.Aired: 2/24/2008Ep 6: Crazy Handful of Nothin' - The side effects of chemo begin to plague Walt, who is also cooking meth again. Jesse's friend, Skinny Pete, introduces him to a distributor named Tuco, but things go awry and Jesse ends up hospitalised.Aired: 3/2/2008Ep 7: A No-Rough-Stuff Type Deal - Walter accepts his new identity as a drug dealer after a PTA meeting. Elsewhere, Jesse decides to put his aunt's house on the market, and Skyler is the recipient of a baby shower.Aired: 3/9/2008Special Features Included In The Set Are:Commentaries on episodes one and six by actor Bryan Cranston (Walter White), series creator Vince Gilligan and the largest commentary cast of actor's I've ever heard with everyone on the show from Aaron Paul (who plays Jesse) to RJ Mitte (who plays Walter Jr.).Making of Breaking Bad: A Behind The Scenes Featurette.Inside Breaking Bad: Interviews with cast and crew reveal how they make the series and all the attention to detail that goes into making it realistic as possible.AMC Shootout Interviews: Interviews/Discussions with Bryan Cranston, Vince Gilligan and others taken from the AMC Shootout show.There are also Deleted Scenes, A Photo Gallery, Actor Screen Tests and A Breaking Bad Commercial.I feel this show and the quality being put into it will help make it the next version of the Wire, while Mad Men is more like the equivilant to the next version of Sopranos yet both shows are something entirely of their own. I suggest fans of television that is made like movies give both these series a try. Breaking Bad's first season barely broke the surface of these character's and the storyline possibilties they hold. Thanks for your time.

  I love Breaking Bad!  Yes, it is a bit shocking, especially is you have never had a family member go through cancer/chemo/radiation.  I have, so I appreciated the realistic way BB showed it.  Heartbreaking, but very realistic.  I am totally drawn to Breaking Bad, watched 1st season and am now just starting to watch the 1st episode of Season 2.  I have always loved Bryan Cranston, and always will - what a fantastic actor (fantastic is not the ultimate word to describe him, but the closest I can think of).  Bryan is my favorite, favorite actor!

  I was hooked on this show after the first episode. It is has a perfect amount of humor and action. It is about a high school science teacher partnering up with a formal student to make meth.

  Outstanding 1st season!I loved this show!Brian Cranston was hands down ""phenomenal"" as Walter White and easily deserved his Emmy. Aaron Paul is awesome in his role as Jesse Pinkman, and all the other cast members seemed to be a perfect fit.I knew the show was good, because of all the rave reviews, but I was'nt expecting it to be this good! ""Breaking Bad"" Season 1 has a 5 star overall rating here on Amazon.Great writing, great timing and development of the characters. The storyline is dramatic, hilarious and keeps you watching. Just when you think the story is starting to slow down, they nail you with something big!I watch alot of TV seasons on DVD (The Shield, CSI, Rescue Me), because I work at night. I haven't seen a show in its 1st season that was this good, since ""Dexter Sea. 1""!The only bad part about this show, was that the 1st season was only 7 episodes! Looking forward to the next season already!Highly, highly recommended!

  It is like Weeds and Dexter gave birth to one bad @$$ little kid. It says something about today's standards of life when a meth head and a chemist can engage a powerful range of personal growth. There's probably a good joke in that line....But the cook gets burned and finds out he has lung cancer. What's a guy to do when he has a family that depends on him, even after he's gone? Not even the Writer's Strike can get in the way of this train. It's bad. Very bad. And that's good.Why is it that we gravitate towards those who, twenty years ago, who have been abhorrent and never even considered to be 'art' in the media sense of the word. And I guess it says something else about our world today when we've realized not every bad guy is indeed a bad guy. Progressive or the way of the High Road?Whatever. That's all philosophy. Skip the musings and watch a few episodes of this award-winning series. First sampler is one me....

  I dont know how else to say this but BB is one of the greatest tv show of all time.The writing is brilliant.The actors give one of the greatest performances put to film.For me breaking bad has changed the way I look at tv shows.Like everything I thing i watch now is trash compared to  breaking bad.i havent gotten around to  watching the sopranos and the wire but it doesnt matter.In my opinion breaking bad will always be my favorite and greatest tv show.

  ...but I don't think it is the best TV drama of all time as many others have called it.  Have they never heard of shows like The Sopranos? Cop Rock?Still, Breaking Bad is very entertaining.  It tells the story about a man who is a high school chemistry teacher, and he is diagnosed with cancer.  Thinking that his days are numbered, he decides to start cooking Meth with one of his former students so that he can make a lot of extra money.  He does this in an effort to set-up some comfortable savings for his pretty blonde wife, and his mildly-retarded son.The show is fast-paced, and fun to watch.  I like it.

  Breaking Bad is simply incredible. This show, to me, has no weak points. It is, by nature, a very serious show, but, at the same time, has no trouble pulling off comedy.Recommended it to a friend who doesn't watch any drama shows, simply because I knew he'd eat it up. Sure enough, he watched one episode after work one day, and that ended up being the entire first season in one sitting. Needless to say, I have created another Breaking Bad fiend.I feel that this is an unfair comparison, but I am still going to make it: Breaking Bad is a better overall show than Mad Men. Mad Men is the show that introduced me to AMC, and is most likely the reason I was ever introduced to Breaking Bad. Don't get me wrong - Mad Men is still an excellent show, and I will continue to watch it in a adamant fashion. It was my favorite show for the last year or so since I was introduced to it. But Breaking Bad has now taken that place for me.Please, everyone, watch this show. I know that there will be a lot of people out there that will never step off of their ""Moral Highhorse"" and watch it, and that is their loss, quite frankly. If you aren't one of those people, I have a feeling that you won't regret watching Breaking Bad.ENJOY!!!

  Definitely not for children, but a great series if you're a Bryan Cranston fan (from Malcom in the Middle). We especially love it, because it's filmed locally here in Albuquerque & New Mexico. Great story line. Great acting. Very well written & directed, with great attention to detail. You have to see the 1st episode in the series (pilot), before any of the subsequent episodes, or you'll be lost. We're already working on the 2nd season.

  Breaking Bad TV series is an outstanding piece of work from the cast and crew. Kudos to the director for making this one of the very best TV series that I have ever watched in my life. I rarely praise any TV drama but honestly this TV series is one of the most addicting series ever. The work is technically perfect! Everything is well done from acting to sound effects to storytelling. There is something for everyone in the household to watch and enjoy.Warning! After watching this series, you will find most other popular TV series dull and boring! I am confident that within less than 10 mins into the season 1 episode 1 show you will get addicted and cannot stop watching the series.Excellent! 5 Stars!

  This is the best show on television and the best acting. Anyone who knows Bryan Cranston as the doofus dad from Malcom in the Middle will be in awe when seeing this. The Character of Walt White is deep, convoluted and played to perfection by Mr.Cranston. The rest of the cast is fantastic too and we're presented with some of the baddest bad guys ever. If you are a late comer toBreaking Bad, you should startfrom  the beginning because though episodes can probably stand on theirown, the show is mostly about the journey ofthis nice guy kind of loser, to ""the dark side."" If you are a teacher or have kids, lots of opportunity for discussion - when is it justifiable to do bad things?

  I purchased Season 1 of Breaking Bad from iTunes because they had it on sale and I wanted something to watch while I worked out on the elliptical at the gym. I knew the show had received excellent reviews from TV critics so I figured I would give it a try even though it isn't normally the kind of show I'd watch. By the 3rd episode I was hooked. The acting in Breaking Bad is the best. Bryan Cranston, in the role of Walter White, is phenomenal. It is easy to understand why he has won three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.This show has fairly graphic violence, dark humor as well as uplifting and funny moments; the writing and direction is sublime. You will be on the edge of your seat at times, you'll cringe, laugh and be surprised.

  After feeling lost since our favorite series ""Six Feet Under"" was finished it's been like 'blah' for everything since. Until ""Breaking Bad"" came along!!!

  I just finished watching Season 1 of ""Breaking Bad."" It's a good show, which is why I plan to stick with it, at least for now. However, I do not think that it lives up to all the hype surrounding the show AT ALL. The pacing is very slow at times. I hope things drastically pick up in Season 2.

"
  So, I watched 4 seasons in 2 weeks, that is how good this show is.  But just reading the reviews, Aaron Paul, or Jesse, does not get enough credit.  While Bryan Cranston is simply amazing, Paul does not get enough credit.  For me, he makes the show.  He absolutely nails his character.  Critics have said this is perhaps the best TV drama, crime thriller in the history of television... I kinda tend to agree.  While Dexter and Sopranos is just unbelievably good, this is a whole other level.  Primarily because it's unpredictable, the writing is off the charts superb (as is the acting) and the complexities and the depth of the characters is unparalleled in TV history, IMO.  Oh yea, and Saul Goodman.  Probably one of my favorite TV characters of all time.  The show is that good.

  A friend recommended this as one of his favorite shows.  I finally watched the first season and I'm eager to catch up with the other already available seasons.  The characters are interesting, the storyline is compelling, and the actors do a great job.  This is just really well done.
",5
"
  This episode was the best one yet. I really enjoyed the latter half of it because of the raw emotion and reality that it creates for the viewer. The conversation that Walt has with his family and that dynamic is incredible and very thought provoking. The choice that Walt eventually makes is a thrill to discover. Great show - so real.
",5
"
  This season got cut short by the writer's strike, so it's only 7 episodes.  In a sense, I think the strike may have helped the show.  The writers weren't tasked with trying to figure out the show and the characters too soon and with the first season being so short, it gave them a lot of time to really expand upon everything in season 2 (which is phenomenal also).  But what you're getting here is 7 of the finest, most well-written episodes television has ever seen.  Seriously, all 7 are so well-done, and if you watch this first season and aren't obsessed with the show, I'd be very surprised.

  My husband and I bought Season I out of curiosity because of the awards for Bryan Cranston. We were hooked after the first episode. The writing is spectacular and the cast is perfect. We have now watched all five seasons and can't wait for Season 6.  This is a must see series - it will keep you up at night pondering the implications of its plot.

"
  As promised, the acting, cinematography, and general production values are top notch.  But like the Sopranos, I find the content toxic and depressing.  There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape.  This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life.  But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he's destroying even as his own body is wasting away.  I'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers.

  Breaking Bad is probably one of the best shows on TV and I am so happy to have accidentally ""bumped"" into it one night while channel surfing. Not to spoil it for anyone, but it has a very unusual, but very compelling main storyline about a science teacher who resorts to desperate means to generate quick cash. The subplots are also very intriguing. All I can say is thank goodness for basic cable, because without it, quality TV would have gone down the tubes years ago. Another great show on basic cable is

  This show deserves to be mentioned in the discussion of best tv dramas of all time. If future seasons are as good as this season, it will be considered on a par with Sapranos and Six-feet Under.

  My wife and I started to watch this at 9:30 Friday night after a demanding work week, we made ourselves go to bed at 1:30 AM and watch the rest the next day.Very well written story with acting to back it up.

  People have been talking to me about this show forever, so I finally gave it a shot.  Really great writing and I love the characters.

It explores lots of gray areas and will make you look at your own life in a different way.This series has great writing and really kept me on the edge of my seat.

  Hi all, I'll try and be brief with my review of this show, here goes (and no worries, NO SPOILERS!)  Breaking Bad is an Intense drama with some comedic moments to relax the gritty plot.  Bryan Cranston plays a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable cancer, but because he has nothing to leave his pregnant wife and handicapped son, he decides to begin cooking crystal meth.  This leads to all sorts of mind-blowing events that definitely cross the lines of morality in hopes of an ultimately greater good.  I can't really say much more without giving certain details about the show away.  But trust me when I say WATCH THIS SHOW!!  It is an incredible new series that justifies the not so innocent actions of our hero ""Walter White"" who is ultimately trying to make use of his expiring heart of gold to help his family by taking actions no one would even imagine.Season 2 premieres March 8th on AMC.  In recent years many shows with great potential have come and gone quickly without lasting full seasons.  It would be a tragedy to lose this show, above any other.

  I began watching ""Breaking Bad"" recently, after hearing all the praise lavished on it.  After watching the first season (short, only a handful of episodes), I'm not quite hooked but interested.  I'm interested to see how this one plays out.  I hear it gets better with each season, so I'm withholding complete judgment for at least another season. Overall, worth checking out.

  I wonder if people aren't afraid to rate it a little lower just because nobody else did. There are some good characters and some great writing, and the first episode was absolutely riveting. But there are also some long, drawn-out boring parts to most of the remaining episodes.I don't need to see so much angst-ridden family discussion about the main character's disease. I don't need to see the man who's going through chemo vomiting, much less twice. They could have found somebody better to play his wife, I found her to be vaguely annoying, boring and stereotypical.It's almost like a made-for-TV version of a Quentin Tarantino movie.But when it's good, it's great.

  I can say that on Breaking Bad I immediately recognized that I was seeing things that I had never witnessed in film. Far be it from me to spoil anything but this series is pretty well written and takes place in the arid deserts and suburbs of New Mexico and it is very interesting to see a chemistry teacher deal with criminal elements as well as chemical elements.

  One of the best shows ever. All A's. A must watch. Also - it is great for binge watching.

  Though not every episode of Breaking bad has been ""exciting"" in the traditional sense, it has been entertaining. Breaking Bad sort of reminds me of ""Fargo"" for some reason; not exactly a fast paced show, but a lot of stuff happens.The show is about a chemistry teacher who starts dealing meth, although the show sort of has an anti-drug undertone. The story is pretty compelling, and if they don't make it really stupid and over the top next season, I will keep watching.

  Even though this first season was shortened due to the writer's strike at the time, it is still a fantastic start to this great new show. This is a must for any TV lover and especially to Dramedy lovers. Cranston really shows what he's capable of doing on camera and it's not a mystery if you watch the show why he's a 3 time Emmy winner for this role. He plays it perfectly and makes the character totally believable.

  I caught BB last year when AMC was running all three seasons prior to the start of Season 4. I recorded a few of them from Season 1. I watched the first one and knew this is going to be a great show. I recorded all of the 3 seasons but didn't have time to watch any of them at that time. Feeling under the weather one weekend I decided to start watching the series and was addicted like Jessie and friends were addicted to meth. Every show is better than the one before it and each Season it gets better than the last. Genius show all the way around from the writers to the producers and the actors who truly become their characters and play them brilliantly. I have watched shows like Sopranos Six Feet Under Deadwood Dexter and they were great shows up to a point. BB blows them all away and as much as I like to watch the show I think it's very clever planning this show for only 5 seasons. It will end as great as it began so you can't say I watched until like the 7th season and wasn't that good anymore. This is the only TV show I have purchased and have also told people no when they asked  to borrow it. I am still too addicted to share it with anyone;)

  When I first heard about this show I figured we were at the point where a few producers through a hundred different ideas into a hat, pull out five and then make a show about it.  On paper this just sounded like a bunch of lame elements thrown together, but I've been pleasantly surprised.  It manages to take all of those ""lame"" elements and intricately weave them all together in a somewhat (for TV) believable way.If you're a fan of shows like Dexter, Weeds and Sopranos, this show is right up your alley.  It's detail-rich with great characters and interesting twists.  I'm glad they renewed it and I hope they get a few more seasons out of it.  With the way season 2 is shaping up, they're setting it up for quite a few more seasons.  Sweet!

  For the most part, I agree with the glowing tones of most of the users, but I'll just spend this review elaborating and disagreeing.I thought the first 5 episodes were just fantastic. Especially the way they took what you'd think would become a 1 dimensional character and filled them out. There is a character named Hank who at the beginning looks like a stupid racist cop, but in reality has a good heart and is awkward sometimes and just frankly surprises you. Many characters like that. I love the sense of, 'huh, haven't seen that before' that I get from this TV show.However, i think it gets a bit weak right at episode 6. Maybe it's writer's strike stuff in here, but there's a bit too much badassery (visiting Tuco) and, umm, I don't know, CSI like explanations of chemistry stuff...Caused me real concern in the direction of the show, but I'm definitely going to continue on to season 2...

  How can you not like this show?  The complexity of characters is great with the main character and plot gripping and entertaining.

When I still haven't seen season 2, but I expect it to top season 1. The last episode kept me in suspense for season 2 so I can't wait!

  Breaking Bad is the best show on Television. Season One is great, and it only gets better from here. If you haven't watched it yet, stop what you are doing and watch Season One.

  One of my absolute favorite television shows. The writing is amazing. From the series premiere to the series finale - perfection at every turn. I highly recommend Breaking Bad to anyone who wants it all.

  It is true that amazing writing has been transported from movies to television and it is thusly proven in this series.You are never in for a dull moment and you will never be the same again.

  I really don't know why I like this series so much.  It's not the type of thing I usually like.  A few of the times in the early episodes I kept asking myself why am I watching this, but it is good, intriguing and well done.  I am anxious for the second season to be released on DVD.

  Don't watch much tv, but decided to blind pick this show and now I can't stop watching. Watched seasons 1-3 and on my way to buy 4.

  I must say I am not really a fan of dope dealer genres like weeds. This is however way different. It slowly sucks you into the mind of the math teacher and all his frustrations. Just watch 2 or 3 episodes and it sucks you in and never lets you go again. It's getting darker and darker all the time and leaves you like a junkie wanting more and more. You are in luck because there are 4 more seasons, so I am gonna enjoy some more and get my fix.

  Here it goes.The best show on TV,any TV for that matter is Breaking Bad.You name it they have it in full force:acting,story line,cinematography,directing,suspense,humor,action its all there.Love every minute of it.Watch it you will not regret it.

  Best show on Tv.  You never know what might happen on this show. There's always a good twist on every episode.

  Best show ever no matter where you watch it!!
",5
"
  Slow for first two seasons. Gets good season 3-4. Acting is tremendous. Becomes a little outrageous.

"
  First caveat is this show is not uplifting by any means. If you're looking for something with great acting and writing with a director that knows how to shoot scenes so things feel real and you get sucked right into the characters' lives, then this is it. The story is outlandish enough to be interesting and the dialogue is what holds the show together. A brilliant mind created this show.
",5
"
  This has got to be one of the best shows ever. I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. After watching the first episode, my husband and I were hooked. Could hardly wait for the next episode. This show is smart, witty and has some of the best acting I have seen. Don't even think twice about getting the whole season on DVD (unless you are sensitive to bad language and some bloody scenes, but they are worth it.I would rate it ""R"", definitely not for kids or even young teens).
",5
"
  I'm not one to write reviews on amazon, nor do I even hardly even watch TV shows. But Breaking Bad has seem to change my perspective. I absolutly love this TV show. The drama, the suspense, and the action! Are all great in this show. So yeah, im no writer so my review is probably horrible, but the show is fantastic. When they had the writers strike last year I was soooo upset. Im glad its back on the air and season 2 has been rockin!!!!
",5
"
  the quality of the video on the blu-ray edition is pretty good overall but this show stands on it's quality regardless of HD or standard def.  Bryan Cranston's acting is second to none and once you watch a single episode it's hard to stop.  i'm counting the days till the release of season 3 and the start of the 4th season.
",5
"
  If you haven't seen any of Breaking Bad yet, I would recommend starting with the DVD version. I was fortunate enough to see the Pilot for the first time on DVD, and when I saw the broadcast version later I was very disappointed with some of the cuts they made. The scenes with Walter washing his student's car, and holding Hank's gun at the party were some of my favorites in the whole episode, but they're not essential to the plot so you won't see them on T.V. or on AMC's website. I haven't seen Amazon digital version so I don't know if those scenes are intact. If you haven't seen the Pilot yet I would definitely recommend renting or buying the DVD version first.
",5
"
  The key to all the rationalizations is cancer.  Is it terminal?  Who can say?  It's Stage 3A.  Doesn't sound good.  And Walt teaches high school--ergo, he makes so little money that he has to moonlight at a car wash.  His health ""insurance"", like most US health ""insurance"" prior to ObamaCare, is really great until the day comes that you get really sick.  Then you're screwed.  And usually you lose everything and then you die, leaving your family penniless, homeless, and buried under a mountain of debt.So this is supposed to give Walt permission to do a number of bad things, like, 1) traffic in meth, 2) steal lab equipment from his employer, a public school, and, 3) turn a blind eye when an innocent person is accused of the theft and ends up getting fired for ""having a record.""Well, you know, it's all very nice to act like you're a real citizen with upstanding morals and family values, but then comes the day when it actually costs you something to live by those values, and put principle into practice, and that's when most people stumble.And Walt falls flat on his butt.And the fall is made blatantly apparent when Walt refuses a helping hand from someone with the resources to help.  What's the justification for that?  Well, maybe Walt's just too proud.  Because apparently it's better to stand on your own like a real man, even if that means committing multiple felonies and maybe spending the rest of your life in prison.But, really, what's the big deal?  It's TV.  And it's not NYPD Blue, where the lead character hears a fellow officer admit to murder, and does nothing about it.  And it's not the Shield, where one cop murders another cop, and apparently this passes for good wholesome TV entertainment.  And it's certainly not the Sopranos, where you know going in that at least half the characters are murderous thugs who really quite enjoy committing every kind of mayhem.Well, yeah, that's kind of the point.  This guy Walt is a school teacher.  His excuse is slim and none.  And I'm not even bringing up the worst thing he does, with its own special rationalization, because it's one little conundrum the script really doesn't resolve, except by putting the character into an absurd position, where, in effect, Walt invites another character to provide the justification.So, really, while Breaking Bad IS entertaining, bear in mind that it's more of a satire than a ""drama,"" in that it's ""...holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn.""And, uhhh...yeah.  Seven episodes.  Keep that in mind when you're looking at prices.

  I didn't think this show would appeal to me at first- there's a lot of violence and drugs- obviously. But this show is so well done.

  Even though the show is on AMC which prevents then producers from showing scenes thay normally would; this is the best made show ever produced. Most people would say The Sopranos, The Wire, or even Arrested Development but Breaking Bad is by far the best show from front to back and it still has one season left. It doesn't have high viewer ratings but it is a quality show that everyone should see. AMC has been making some great shows for sometime now including Mad Men, The Killing, The Walking Dead, and there best show Breaking Bad. Buy This! In Blu-Ray!

  Had to own this series. The writing, characters, and acting are superb. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman play off each other's unique world views.

  This first season is fantastic.  There are definitely relationship scenes that are skip-worthy, but the story feels original, and interesting. The young guy is dumb, but that's ok, we all know a few dumbies in real life.  The following seasons are OK, but the first season really shines.

  I bought this series blind and absolutely delighted with the series - if a little short! Dark subjects but well written and portrayed with reality and feeling and of course some terrific humour. Only problem is now waiting for the next series to emerge!

  First I want to say that this series is great and if you haven't seen it yet or are unsure about it, the second season is currently airing on AMC, so try to catch a few of them to get a better understanding. If you like those episodes or if you're one of the people who already love this series then this DVD boxed set is for you. It contains the complete first season of AMC's Breaking Bad in seven one hour long episodes.In short the plot is a more serious Bryan Cranston than we've seen playing chemistry teacher Walter White, who gets diagnosed with cancer. With a son, Walter Jr, who is disabled and a wife, Skyler, who is pregnant with her second child in her late thirties he decides the best way to take care of his family is to start making crystal meth with one of his old dead beat students, Jesse. The further he goes to try and provide for his family the darker and more complicated his life becomes with crazy drug dealer's, increasing extended family issues with his wife's sister, Marie, and to top it off a bother in law, Hank, who is a Drug Enforcement Administration Officer.The episodes found on this set are:Ep 1: Pilot - Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer. With a new lease on life, Walter becomes a drug dealer to secure his family's financial security.Aired: 1/20/2008Ep 2: Cat's in the Bag... - Following their debacle in the desert, Walter and Jesse are left with a mess to dispose of. Later, Skyler grows suspicious of Walt's recent activity.Aired: 1/27/2008Ep 3: ...and the Bag's in the River - Walter is left to deal with Krazy-8 alone following an argument with Jesse. After Marie raises concerns that Walt Jr. is smoking cannabis, Hank shows him the dangers of drug use.Aired: 2/10/2008Ep 4: Cancer Man - The DEA becomes suspicious of a new drug kingpin. Walt reveals that he has cancer to Marie and Hank. Elsewhere, Jesse visits his estranged family.Aired: 2/17/2008Ep 5: Gray Matter - Walter and Skyler attend a former colleague's party. Jesse tries free himself from the drugs. Later, Skyler organizes an intervention for Walt.Aired: 2/24/2008Ep 6: Crazy Handful of Nothin' - The side effects of chemo begin to plague Walt, who is also cooking meth again. Jesse's friend, Skinny Pete, introduces him to a distributor named Tuco, but things go awry and Jesse ends up hospitalised.Aired: 3/2/2008Ep 7: A No-Rough-Stuff Type Deal - Walter accepts his new identity as a drug dealer after a PTA meeting. Elsewhere, Jesse decides to put his aunt's house on the market, and Skyler is the recipient of a baby shower.Aired: 3/9/2008Some people have said that the new season has taken too long to air but they must not realize AMC and HBO take a year between seasons of all their big shows. The second season is currently airing (started March 8th 2009), which happens to be one year after the first. Only the first episode into the second season and already it's become more riveting, intense, dramatic and complex than the first season. The second season premiere really left us with a shocking ending that leaves one eagerly awaiting how the rest of the season will follow.I feel this show and the quality being put into it will help make it the next version of the Wire, while Mad Men is more like the equivilant to the next version of Sopranos yet both shows are something entirely of their own. I suggest fans of television that is made like movies give both these series a try. Breaking Bad's first season barely broke the surface of these character's and the storyline possibilties they hold. Thanks for your time.*Rather than clutter up the review page I have listed the special features included with this set in my comments section for those wondering about them.

  I don't usually rant about TV shows. But I found these censor edits WAY too distracting to watch any more of this show.They say the DVD version is uncensored - Unfortunately, I've been soured on the whole experience. I sadly bought the entire season, and I have no desire to watch any more seasons. I'm sorry some people don't like the fact that I didn't appreciate the censorship. But this is America, not everybody has to enjoy having their art ripped apart because someone thinks they shouldn't hear a word or see an image.And what is MORE annoying is not only did they somehow THINK that distracting the audience by deleting words and blurred out shots would somehow make you like the show more, the things they choose to censor are bizarre. For example, apparently in their minds it perfectly OK to say the words ""F*gg*t"", Sh[..], Bit[..] and Bulls[...] however, showing showing a women's breasts for 1 second is somehow a horrible sin. WTF!!! Seriously, Who are these people?

  I usually get bored with movies, etc... But this is the BEST show I've ever seen! The first season is still my favorite because they pull you in and you can't stop watching!

  I was VERY late to the game on this show, but even with all the hype and awards, it still exceeded my expectations. I can't believe it's on tv not just for its dark subject matter and violence, but because it's so much better than most feature films! The direction, cinematography, editing, acting - it's all the best of the best, and NOT just ""for tv."" BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION. Believe it yo.

  I think many, when looking at the main star of this show (Bryan Cranston) will have only really been familiar with him from Malcolm In The Middle. He played Hal, a simple Dad with simple values and an unbeatable love for his family. Who would have thought that he can take a character with the same basic love of his family and create something incredibly unique from that. In Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry professor Walter White who's married with a handicap son who suffers from Cerebral Palsy and a child on the way.One day Walter is hit with the ultimate bombshell as he finds he has inoperable lung cancer and has little time left to live. Walter realises that he can't assure his families financial security for the little time he has left being a teacher. He hears about a raid on a crystal meth lab that seizes millions of dollars worth of drugs which he decides that he must be a part of that. He knows how to make the best crystal meth ever seen, but not how to get it on the streets which is why he must enlist the help of his former student and drug pusher Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).I honestly didn't have high hopes for this show as, although I'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston for his work on Malcolm In The Middle, I struggled to believe he could pull off such a train wreck of a character. The family is a typical middle class American family struggling to take care of their disabled son trying to make him have as normal a life as possible. In a way I can relate to the situation as I'm disabled myself and know how much of a strain it can be on parents. Sure, it's not the same disability, but the family struggling through it is definitely displayed well and R.J. Mitte as Walter Jr. is an excellent fit. Although I'm betting he was only cast because he too has Cerebral Palsy, he still fits the bill and plays the character brilliantly.Fantastic, fantastic show. I don't want to tell you much about the seasons events as it is quite short and risks spoiling certain events. I have to tell you that there are times in which this show doesn't hold back. It has no qualms about showing you the brutality of a broken man fighting against his own sense of morality, joining the drug world and even dealing with the fact that he killed a guy. Oh and obviously he's dying and is reminded of that from time to time but it's certainly gelled together brilliantly.Just to wrap it up I can only really say this TV show is amazing in every way and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. Bryan Cranston is a very underrated actor, but he's determined to prove himself for which he does a terrific job. When this DVD set comes out in the UK I'll certainly be one of the first to buy it.

"
  Thoroughly enjoyed it!

  I don't get why this show is so popular or gets so much awards attention. It fizzled is probably the best description I can give it. There's something there that could be good, but it never quite catches my attention enough to entertain me or to make me watch more than about the handful of episodes I watched. My sister got the DVD set for me, so at least I'm not out of money for it, but it's a disappointment because I had been eager to watch it nonetheless.
",1
"
  I watched the entire first season in one sitting and enjoyed it very much but felt the show could have benefitted from at least one scene illustrating the havoc that crystal meth can create in the lives of many of its abusers and Walter White's reaction to it. I mean, I can't recall any scene where White expresses one shred of regret for what he unleashes upon the world. And I couldn't stop thinking of the countless methamphetamine addicts White would help create after they took thier first hit of his purer-than-pure drug and chased it forever thereafter to thier utter ruin. White seems so decent and morally-driven that I doubt he wouldn't have considered this as well. A great show though overall. Bryan Cranston is a wonderful actor.

  I was really blown away by the first few episodes of this, which would have made a heart-pounding (and self-contained) movie in their own right.But as the show wore on (especially in the second season), its attempts to create tension began to feel more and more artificial until they were simply transparent.  A good example of this would be the actions of Tuco, who would never have risen to be the don of a little crime empire had he been so hotheaded.It seems like after blowing their initial wad, the writers had nothing left but simple cliff-hanging suspense, which they didn't scruple to resort to even in minor scenes.  By the end of the second season, this was the only merit the show could boast.  It got so predictable.  It was as if as soon as things were cooling off, one character would start acting irrationally merely so that there wouldn't be a letup.  At one point in the second season, Jesse asks Walt, ""6 grand a day we're making!  What's your problem?!""  I'd love it if Walt had said:  ""Hey, I have to have some sort of problem to keep the tension up in the script!""How long do they think they can go on with this premise?  I imagine the show by the tenth season, Walt, at 80, never quite succumbing to cancer, Jesse, middle-aged now with a family, the two of them having escaped detection by a hair's breadth a thousand times over the course of four decades . . .

  I remember back when I had cable AMC was a completely different channel. I know they are trying to provide edgier content to keep up with HBO & Showtime, but I was a little disappointed with some of their choices when making this series. It is well acted & has great writing with an dark sense of humor. Just could do without the cursing, nudity, & graphic sex scenes. Not having those in it wouldn't have detracted any from the show. I guess just not really my thing.

  The DVD version of Breaking Bad is uncensored. Amazon VOD is not. There is no additional content but certain words are not blanked out and certain screens are not blurred.

  The pilot was good enough to get me to see the first episode. The first episode was bad enough to keep me from seeing the second episode. The humor is for school kids. I would have liked it if I was still in school. The DVD was a gift so I'll push through to the second episode. I hope it gets more intelligent.If I was terminal I would let my wife know and I wouldn't start a carrier destroying other people lives before I died.

  the pilot had some pixilation issues, hopefully it wont be a problem in later episodes. the pilot was okay, kinda slow.

  I thought this show was an interesting fantasy.  It is set in a pretend world where high school teachers need to work second jobs and don't have health insurance or pension plans.  A magic place where cancer is diagnosed and the prognosis is known in one day.  Unfortunately for the future of this show lung cancer that is amenable to chemo only has an untreated life expectancy of less than a year and sometimes much less than that. This show takes place in a magic place where brilliant chemistry teachers don't take elementary life precautions like get life insurance.  In this magic place, the moral depravity to create a deadly drug that ruins lives for the financial betterment of yourself seems easy and natural.If you can get beyond the above and a bunch of other dreary cliches this show is not bad if you are into the current stream of shows about miserable people and the depraved lives they live.  Vicious people that you would hate to actually know but we all like to watch.  In this genre this show does pretty well.  And the main character is a fantastic actor who makes the show worth watching even as an amoral person.

  Three stars for Cranston's solid acting.  But geeze.  Teacher with a wife, son with medical problems, and baby on the way...doesn't have life insurance?  Learns he has cancer and thinks, well, I'll just sell meth.  Hm.  I don't see the psychological or economic basis.  And that absence lingers throughout.  The first season leads to that dreadful scene in the drug merchant's lair...with lots of bad acting and that ridiculous explosion.  This is stuff for adolescent boys of a certain ilk.  But Cranston is terrific.

  So i just have to say i love Breaking Bad.But somehow someone at Sony Home Video must be smoking whatever meth they have on the set, just kidding.but for 7 episodes on blu-ray, $40 list price.  on sale at amazon for $28.  that is too pricey. When these cable networks do their thing and give a new series a shot, i love it, but to charge this much for it?  nutz.

  I was really impressed with everything about this show. However, there is way too much dramatic tension for my taste, and I don't consider myself a drama lightweight. After watching the second and third episode yesterday, I couldn't sleep last night. I kept getting woken up by flash-backs.This definitely needs an R rating! I sure wouldn't want kids seeing this.

  The only reason I gave one star for this product is due to the advertised ""closed captioning.""I enjoy this show immensely but didn't start watching it until season 4.  So I started with catchup by renting the DVDs on netflix, only to find out that there are no English subtitles for SDH.The DVDs are advertised as ""closed-captioned""  but that has never worked with any DVD player I ever owned - I even tried it at a friend's house - he is a super geek and couldn't determine how these alleged closed captions were supposed to work.I finally broke down and paid the extra on Netflix for streaming the show on my PC, which thank God, does offer the subtitles in English.  But my computer's not the greatest, so either way, I'll be forking out additional $$$ for either a Blu-Ray or a new computer.

  A terminally ill chemistry professional adds to his income by producing and selling drugs, more and more sucked in a world of illegal deals and crime.A story is interesting as a sound example of going-all-the-way from a law-obedient model citizen to hard core crime doing everything to sustain family wellbeing in harsh time.A reviewer is unsure of educative value of this standing apart produce but situations shown have been provided by tragic-comic way professionally.

  This is a great show and I have zero complaints about the quality of the product. My only problem is that with the cost of shipping your order will come to roughly $30 for what you will find to be only a seven episode season.

  This dvd arrived in a timely fashion which I gave as a Christmas gift. When tried to watch the DVD it had the sound from the directors review dubbed onto the pilot of the series so we were not able to watch the pilot which made the rest of the series harder to get. Stated was watched once but doubt that since it was damaged.

  This show was written by dirty scoundrels who hate the show ""Weeds"".  Watch ""Weeds"" and try to tell me that Breaking Bad isn't a complete rip off.  In Weeds a woman goes through a radical discovery/event in her life and turns to selling drugs to support her family.  At least the main character is attractive and capable of expressing emotions unlike Walter White who is just a hairy old man who does nothing but make the same exact ""shocked"" face after every single bad thing happens to him.When I first watched this show I loved it.  I worshiped it.  I became one with the show.  But then I saw ""recommended for you""... ""Weeds, season 1"" and I watched it.  My life has changed.  Everything I thought about this show was wrong.Also, as far as ""realistic"" shows go, Breaking Bad is Star Wars.  There are so many ridiculous scenes (like at the end of episode 2).  Walter is a horrible ""It's not fair"" old bitter man character and Jesse Pinkman is a typical ""yeah, baby, it ain't fair baby, it ain't far baby"" 22 year old gangster character.After episode three the entire story of the TV show is done but instead of stopping they start all over again.  Then they do the same thing twice during season 2 and 3.  It's just awful.  Just because they have high quality cameras doesn't make this a good show.On a side note, there's a lot of not-so-subtle anti-Mexicano racism in this.  Most Mexicans (and blacks for that matter) are shown as drug dealers or being involved in crime somehow while white people are just trying to live their upper class lives, protecting their families.  Maybe I'm the only who feels for our Mexican brethren but I don't believe they deserve this kind of treatment.

  I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the ""hype"" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media.  This show is another one of those ""con"" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It's depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn't.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry.  The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.

  The pilot was very good but the rest of the first season can b slow at xs. Keep watching right now ur just learning about the characters, itll pick up.....Walts a teacher w cancer and a baby on the way and hes deserate anough for money that he decides to make meth. He involves jesse his former student because unlike walt jesse knows quite a bit about selling meth since thats basically all hes done w his life since hs. Walts the serious intelligent one w alot of probs and jesse is the carefree young one looking for cash and to have more drugs to smoke. Jesse is in the begining the shows comic releif. Besides walt and jesse many of the characters in the beg bugged me. Again i say keep watching they will grow on you and u will learn to love of all of em. This isnt the best season of breaking bad by far. But it is where it all began. It is where u c the hs chemistry teacher begin to cook meth and u understand y hed do it. His story is a sad one but jesse helps keep u laughing through out.  The two actors also have great chemistry and r very good together. The writing is very good too. This isnt the best of breaking bad but its better than most tv so i still give it a five.  And id recomend anyone watch it. I always do.

  Why do we, those that love the 'Breaking Bad' franchise, like two guys that indulge in illegally producing and selling a substance that ultimately destroys lives ?I can only point to the film 'The Godfather' and its sequels ----- about men who sell illegal liquor, organize  prostitution, promote illegal gambling, bribe corrupt politicians and police, murder rivals ruthlessly  etc., etc. The characters were so well written, the plot sumptuously compiled, the dialogue apt for the time ( ""I made him an offer that he couldn't refuse"") we loved the films and the men committing the crimes.'Breaking Bad' is cleverly written to ensure that our loyalties rest with the two partners in crystal meth making---- one a straight chemistry teacher diagnosed  with terminal cancer who 'cooks' the drug to fund his cancer treatment and safeguard his family's uncertain future. The other is basically a yob but he too is trying to reach out to his estranged family to whom he is regarded as a failure.They're doing something illegal yes, but they mix in a dangerous world of psychotic gangsters and users and need to survive beatings and police investigations to reach their goal. Season 1 sets the background of our two main protagonists including their dysfunctional families and succeeds in establishing a huge fan base with a superb opening story line that needs to be followed.I've recognized Tuco, a merciless gangster, from the opening season of 'Better Call Saul' in which a younger, more flexible Tuco compromised over a punishment given to two offenders. He broke their legs instead of giving them a 'Colombian Necktie' . As my header suggests the series is not for the sensitive but neither was the Godfather, yet there is so much fine acting, such meaningful dialogue and such a compelling story line that you may forgive the bursts of unsavoury behaviour depicted by characters throughout the series. English subtitles including Hard Of Hearing. Picture and sound are excellent and what you'd expect from a top class tv series and the success of this opening season ensures that the next season will get a bigger budget and give us even finer entertainment.

  Very well made, original series that maintains its standards in subsequent seasons.Nice to see a subject like chemistry being made potentially cool.Breaking Bad tells the story of Walter White who we first see as a High School Chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but who once had greater ambitions as an industrial research chemist co-founding his own company, until he lost that chance by quarrelling with his then business partner.When Walter is diagnosed with a fatal illness, knowing he has not made enough money as a teacher to provide adequately for his family after his death, using his ordinary, respectable job as a cover, he decides to use his scientific skills to make money fast and dangerously. He does so by secretly manufacturing the illegal drug crystal methamphetamine to an exceptionally high quality and purity.Aided by his former pupil, the volatile Jesse, played by Aaron Paul, Walter becomes drawn into a world previously foreign to him of drug dealing networks, money laundering and murderous drug barons, with whom he learns to co-operate and then compete, and shows a ruthless streak himself.You might think Walter's original motive of making money to provide for his family after he is gone comes close to excusing what he does, yet the strains of his secret criminal career threaten to break up his marriage and family. His need for money is also partly due to being too proud to ask his former business partner for help.This means that although this programme is sufficiently well made that we can become involved enough to actually want Walter and his side-kick Jesse not to be caught, Walter is never fully likeable. The makers of this series intended it that way, as they, rightly, do not want us to go away thinking that supplying illegal drugs is a `cool' career choice. However, this also creates the one major weakness of `Breaking Bad' as entertainment: we can be interested in the central character and what he does, but we cannot really like him.Hence, although Breaking Bad has won many awards, is interesting to watch and I recommend it, compared to the early Seasons of another very good and original US crime related series of recent years that also has with a morally ambiguous hero, Dexter, while Breaking Bad may on balance be just slightly the better of 2 very good programmes for acting, directing and script writing, I found the early Seasons of Dexter just slightly more enjoyable to watch.

  A family saga, a personal drama, a black comedy. Breaking Bad is all these things and more. This short but very sweet first series introduces two of the most well rounded, well written characters to grace our screen. Their tenuous relationship alone is enough to float this series.Walter White is a good man who teaches chemistry and has lived a normal life. That is until he is diagnosed with lung cancer. He panics, despairs but most of all worries for his family's future. After all his wife is expecting a baby. He unexpectedly bumps into an old student of his in a rather compromising situation. This could be his way out.Combining his chemistry skills with the ""business links"" that Jesse has, his new partnership takes to making the best drugs in town, and so their mini-adventure begins.The series works because there are so many layers to the story. On the surface this does just seem like a drug fable with the normal tropes thrown in. Peel back some of those layers and you will see a family struggling to cope with the prospect of losing the head of the house. On top of all this you have Walter struggling to create the drugs whilst keeping any violence to a minimum. He struggles with the morality of the whole situation. Does he continue to risk people getting hurt for the money or does he walk away and leave his family in dire straits.Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are superb. They play of each other wonderfully and their tense partnership is both sweet and destructive. Over the 7 episodes they really grow together and the story really excels when they are together.The writers of Breaking Bad have skilfully woven a story and a superb character arc into such a short space of time. With one of the best written characters around it had to be a supreme actor to take up the role. Bryan Cranston delivers in spades. He is strong, emotional and sometimes utterly terrifying. He has a moral compass which sways erratically and he goes from being the meek teacher to the ultimate dealer. A character up to his knees in a cesspit, Cranston gives him heart and in turn makes the audience support him even though it doesn't feel right to.Aaron Paul shouldn't go without a mention either. His bubbly, erratic Jesse is the superb counter to Walter's downbeat persona. He bounds around spitting insults and avoiding the police as if it is the most natural thing in the world. He can't understand why a bumbling old chemistry teacher is helping him out, but he doesn't care when the product is this good.A criminally short lived series that begs you to move on to series two. Breaking Bad is television at its best.

  I had not heard much about Breaking Bad, I took a chance. So glad I did. It really is one of the best American TV shows out there at the moment. I watch a lot of TV shows I find them more entertaining than movies, and Breaking Bad is a gem, probably up there in the top ten of the last 10 years.To give a brief outline, Walter is a chemistry teacher and he knows his stuff!, he is like most people a hard working loyal family man, he has been hit by some hardships his health takes a turn for the worse and it is at that point he realises that with his average home, pay and life the treatment he will need will bury his family in so much debt that not only will he not get well and see his unborn child he will leave his family destitute.His brother-in law is a DEA agent, and after seeing an enormous drug bust Walter comes up with a plan he enlists his ex high school pupil Jessie to help.This is a story of desperation, family, and what a man has to do to survive, It is very dark in places, but has some purely magical moments which lift the mood and balance the show out. It has a real humour in the writing and the way the characters interact.An outstanding series. which builds momentum, it is believable, and trust me you'll never look at camper vans in the same light after watching this!

  A chemistry teacher, Walter White, finds out he has terminal lung cancer and but a short few months to live. Determined not to tell his family, an unexpectedly pregnant wife, Skyler, and teenage son with cerebral palsy, RJ Mitte, he sets about preparing for his death by thinking of a scheme to leave them with the biggest amount of money possible - meth. A chance encounter with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, who is now a drug dealer, sets the wheels turning and the two become an unlikely team - he cooks the meth using his years of chemistry experience and Jesse distributes it. But how does he keep all of this secret from his family, especially his brother in law who is a Drug Enforcement Agent? Throw in the troubles that come with selling meth and the scene is set for one of the best TV series of the last 10 years.Bryan Cranston does a star turn in his role as Walter White, bringing an intensity and empathy to a character in such a way that he always gives a memorable performance in each episode and fashions a unique character along the way. Aaron Paul does a brilliant job bringing to life the character of Jesse Pinkman and giving him the humanity you perhaps wouldn't feel for a drug dealer. Anna Gunn does an even better job in the role of Skyler White than she did in her last role in ""Deadwood"" (another AMAZING series) and creates a complex and conflicted character with real depth.Though the first season is short (7 episodes) each one is packed with wonderful dialogue and plotting as we see Walter and Jesse bumble their way through the stages of creating a drug dealing business and overcoming the many obstacles along the way, namely rival dealers, and Walter juggling the time he spends away from his family cooking meth and hiding his illness. It all makes for utterly absorbing television and is yet another jewel in the crown of American drama TV, putting to shame British TV where all we seem to do is create exportable formats in the shape of talent contests, games of luck, and dance shows.""Breaking Bad"" is mesmerising TV and this is coming from a guy who rarely watches TV. After just 3 episodes I saw round a friend's house I had to buy the 1st and 2nd series and I was not disappointed in the least. You won't regret getting to know Walter White and Jesse Pinkman and their complex world. Roll on Season 3!

  When you first hear this show is about a Chemistry teacher who contracts cancer then makes Crystal meth to leave a nest egg for his family, you really dont know what to expect.As several of my friends and family recommended this show to me I had to give it a go.Im not the best at leaving reviews on TV and Music but I have to say that I have never watched a show with Such interesting and yet tragic charcaters, each character has their own subplot.And everytime my Wife and I finihsed an episode we both say I cant wait to see the next one.The first series is short 7 episodes and each one gets better and better by 6 & 7 the scene is set and even though bad things are being done, real anti heros are born.The show has a real dark humour about it, and covers 2 very serious issues Cancer and how it effects family live and also drug dealing.From start to finish as you progeress through each series you begin to see that what Walt Snr is doing has a major butterfly effect.Its about family, and love, and deceit, and lies, and fun and so on and so forth.in Summary, great show, brilliantly wirtten with superb characters that will leave you wanting to speed your way thorugh each series

  I happened to come across this whilst randomly browsing on Amazon one evening. All I can say is, it's one of the best things I've seen for a long time. The writing is sharp, witty and clever and the acting is superb, as is the storyline.The main character, Walter White, is played by Bryan Cranston (who plays Hal in Malcolm in the Middle). White is a high school chemistry teacher who is told he has terminal cancer. In response, he decides to do what he can to secure his family's financial future, and this is where the rulebook he seems to have adhered to his whole life, is thrown out with the trash. White uses what he knows best: his chemistry knowledge to make crystal meth and thus follows a chaotic, comedic and, at times, painful and tragic chain of events. White also seems to embark on a voyage of self-discovery; plus we discover things about his past, the decisions he made previously and how they impacted on his life, and the decisions he is making now, which are impacting on many others.The supporting characters also add great humour and depth to the story lines. White is supported by his pregnant wife, Skylar, who has no idea about what is going on; his dopey DEA agent brother-in-law regales White with stories of crime crackdowns with no idea he is cohorting with a minor druglord and his hyper sister-in-law, Marie, has her own secrets. White's partner-in-crime, Jesse, is superbly played by Aaron Paul and the partnership is almost Laurel and Hardy at times.Beneath the surface though, there is the reminder of what the drug scene is really about - the ruined lives, the violence, deaths, fear. We see two parallel and vastly different worlds existing side by side with White keeping a foot in each, trying desperately not to bring the two together.'Breaking Bad' is black comedy at its best but beware it is quite gory in parts!

  I am a great fan of the new genre where the 'hero' of a serial show is actually an 'anti-hero'.  It started with the characters in '6 Feet Under', was brought into sharper focus by 'Dexter', and now we have the likeable but mis-guided 'Nurse Jackie'. However, as good as that is, THE series I've found most addictive (!) is the unbelievable, unpredictable 'Breaking Bad' !The subject matter is not one I'd usually find interesting but it is used carefully to bring humour and drama, light and shade to each episode, and is so original and well-written it is almost impossible to predict WHAT will happen next.Bryan Cranston is perfect as the initially 'mild-mannered teacher' who turns into a 'drug lord',  but also I immediately felt I knew all the main characters as they are so well-written. And to be truthful we finished series one in a week and ordered series 2 !It's a tribute to the progamme that I actully remember the writer's name ~ Vince Gilligan ~ the first time this has happened since Alan Ball of '6 Feet Under'.'Breaking Bad' is superb televsion, which could only be superseded if someone persuaded Vince Gilligan and Alan Ball to write a series together.

  Unusual plot, great acting, droll humour and chemistry, who could ask for more? The opening of the first episode is almost surreal - a man in his underwear and wearing a gas mask driving an RV across the desert. Huh? It all becomes clear, but what an impact it makes.Mind you, the chemistry does occasionally go a bit awry (mercury fulminate is incredibly unstable, which is why it's used in detonators, but it does not have THAT sort of explosive power). All the characters are great, each with his or her individual quirks, flaws and blind spots. Best of all is Walt, determined at all costs to provide for his family, and at the end of this series just starting to realise how high that cost may be. Well worth your time.

  I bought this for a friend because I loved the series so much and thought she would like it as much as I did. You know when they say a book is unputdownable? Well, some TV shows are like that. If you have the box set of Breaking Bad, you'll want to watch one episode after another until the end. So compelling. Such fun. Original, thought-provoking and thoroughly entertaining.

  Suprisingly I never knew about Breaking Bad considering this is created by The X Files Brain Boff Vince Gilligan. I loved every single episode. This is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered. Originally shown on the FX channel (FX Channel who?!?!) their publicity was not known or advertised into the mainstream. I am surprised one of the 4 major networks here in the UK has not picked it up - It deserves to be screened. For those who ask - what is it about? Well it's pretty much this in a rounded way; Man discovers he has cancer. Man needs money for family. Man makes meth. Man gets involved in criminality. Man sells Meth. Adventure pursues...Does not sound much to it, but it gets you hooked with it's wit, the hilarious one liners and most of all - the acting by all the cast. You cannot help but fall in love with each character due to their natural nature and personification to our norm. Gilligan removes everything conventional hollywood and replaces it with everything au naturel. This deserves to be recognised as one of the greatest TV shows of all time, I am totally hooked.

  This is hands down one of the best TV series of all time. There is something in it for everyone. The story follows a man with terminal cancer who funds his treatment through illegitimate means. Highly recommended.

  Intriguing complexity of characters develops with each episode.  The plot takes  them through some hilarious and gruesome turns, and veers between a touching account of marital and family stresses and a storyline which becomes more bizarre as Walt and Jesse become more embroiled in their criminal activities.  All the characters involved are carefully delineated so that their interaction intensifies your identification with their experiences. There are many knowing and effective glances at the black humour of Tarantino, the Coen Brothers and others to be enjoyed if you do enjoy picking up cinematic references, but they are smoothly integrated into the fateful playing out of  the plot as events get disastrously out of hand and the main characters have to devise ingenious but even riskier ways out.  Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul become a sort of sinister Laurel and Hardy!I have come to this series late, and did so because it was recommended so highly by so many people.  They were absolutely right.

  Quite brilliant, as is the entire series. Tragic in the Shakespearian sense by the end of the fifth season. Been around for a while now, but if you haven't seen it, plunge in. Wonderfully creative, riveting stuff. Superbly written, directed and acted. Can't recommend it too highly.

  Struggling with this one.  Bought it after Games of Thrones was over and we were looking for something to fill in the time before the next season of GOT.  The acting is great and it is funny/shocking but for some reason only got to the second episode.  Perhaps I just need to to persevere!!

  Season three is where everything really kicks off ... but up until then the first two series set the scene quite well. If you just watched season 1 you'd probably think this series is quite slow and wonder what the fuss is all about, but keep going. I like Cranston, have done ever since his comedy stint in Malcolm in the Middle, and it goes without saying that his portrayal of a man on the edge (with a completely repressed ego) will get him a few big gigs in the next couple of years before inevitably fading back into television series. All that future success is all based on this show.

  One of the best TV series EVER (and believe me I've watched a lot !). The first episode is a good indication of what you're about to receive. Out of curiosity I read the negative reviews. Well, I shouldn't actually be that surprised. Some people think they're smart but they're only smart enough to understand ""Dexter"" (not that ""Dexter"" is bad, on the contrary, but it's ""easy viewing"" : a good ""bad"" guy who makes the world a safer place to live in). One of them calls ""Breaking Bad"" an empty vessel. Well, I think that's an accurate description of his head ...

  This is a great series, but I wish somebody had told whoever authored these blu-rays that it is possible to have a bookmark option on disks. If you stop watching in the middle of an episode, you can't bookmark and resume play. You have to go to the nearest chapter stop or begin at the beginning of the episode. If you begin at the beginning of an episode, you have to sit through the various MPAA/NSA/FACT/Homeland Security/IRS anti-pirating warnings every time. I BOUGHT the discs! Why do I have to wade through these warnings over and over and over?

  Having arrived late to the 'Breaking Bad' party, I'm not really into popular TV shows that are currently in fashion but having heard so much about this (mainly from Reddit, Imgur, Twitter...) I had to give it a try.The pilot represents the series perfectly and whatever your reaction at that should be a good guide as to whether you'll fall in love with this show as so many have. Slow paced with few characters and a concentration on storyline, this is so well made it fully deserves the 9.4/10 rating it has on IMDb. My only problem is now avoiding spoilers so I can enjoy the other 4 series.

  A friend of mine had been ranting on about 'Breaking Bad' for months, about how good it was. Finally I got season 1 and was pleasantly surprised at how right my friend was, Breaking Bad is an awesome show that makes you laugh, makes you think and also can be quite sad at times.I personally will be getting the rest of the seasons and recommend to anyone and everyone to give it a watch and see if they like it.

  This program is sensational. Brian Cranston is brilliant and the writing is so good, you almost begin to feel this is something you might have done in his place, which is not to say that it makes crystal meth look like a realistic career path. Dreadful things happen, over and over again. My son couldn't stop watching as he had to know what happened next: I could only watch one episode at a time as the emotional overload was too painful. Don't look for happy endings, but brace yourself and enjoy the ride.

  I lost an entire night of sleep to this thing. It's so compelling. The only annoying aspect, is that I'm aware there have been subsequent series' made, so I know that he makes it to the end. This does take a bit of tension out of the experience, yet the performance of Bryan Cranston, coupled with the amazing writing, is truly addictive. I'm sure one could write endless pages about the moral questions thrown up by this show, and no doubt those pages have been written, but suffice to say, love him or hate him (he's my hero), Walter White will not allow you ignore him.

  Short season 1, just 7 episodes.  For me ranging from slow, dragging episodes where not much happens to amazingly brilliant fast moving, edge of seat episodes.Blu ray quality is excellent, the menu system is odd though, easy to press the wrong option.  Reasonably good extras.Basically a good quality intro into what everyone says rivals the wire as best series ever.  I'm still with the wire but roll on season 2.

  Honestly, WATCH IT NOW. It's my favourite TV show alongside The Walking Dead, but for completely different reasons. It's original, funny, scary, sad, disgusting, shocking, and fun. It's just got a bit of everything for everyone and it gets insanely good as the seasons go on. I can't impress upon everyone how worth it is to buy this set, which I've bought for my mum as it really is also for all ages from late teenage up. I myself am going to wait until the end of season 5 is out then buy it in a super blu ray case. :)

  All the good things you have heard about Breaking Bad, are true!Meth may be very addictive, but I am hooked on this series.

  This is a tough-talking series, wonderfully scripted, and jaw-droppingly informative. Superb acting by the always excellent Bryan Cranston makes the show as addictive as the Crack they're 'cooking'. Only flaw is his 'family'--whom we're supposed to simperingly love--are all obnoxious, particularly the women [scriptwise, they don't behave like any normal females would]. But maybe they're annoying & undeveloped in order to make the 'Heroes' seem preferable and interesting despite their work.  Superb stuff!

  I have just finished the first disc; the whole of the first series, and have ordered the second series.  It shows that doing the wrong things for the right reasons doesn't work and only escalates to further wrongs because it distorts the available options.  Brilliant acting and interesting photography.  Fading to black between sequences emphasises the short steps to damnation.  I am looking forward to see how the action develops.

  Having heard all the hype around this show, I thought why not give it a go. Having been dissapointed by The Soprano's and Mad Men-Great shows but over hyped, I was expecting similar from Breaking Bad.Boy was I wrong, right from the first episode breaking bad is gripping, fantastically written and incredibly acted show, which is well worth all the hype.The show centers around Walt White (Bryan Cranston-3 time emmy winner from this role) a high school chemistry teacher who gets a terminal Lung cancer diagnosis. Worried about the cost of medical bills and leaving his pregnent wife (Anna Gunn) and Son with CP (RJ Mitte) something ones he's gone, he teams up with former student Jesse Pinkman (2 time emmy winner for this role-Aaron Paul)to cook and distribute Crystal Meth.I can highley reccomend Breaking Bad..and having finnished the season in 1 day, season 2 is already orderd!

  Breaking Bad is a series i will never forget, gripped me from episode one, it is action packed, violent and documents a ""nice guys"" fall into the criminal world slowly but surely whilst he struggles with illness, family life, financial trouble, lessening respect from family and peers.the chemistry (pardon the pun) between jesse and walt (the main characters) played by aaron paul and bryan cranston is perfect and my advice is to buy the whole series because after 1 episode i was hooked!all about the path we take.

  This has bleak, black humour and represents the depth to which our post-modern world has descended.  But why do i love it ? How ordinary ? Mr White ?  We all had teachers called Mr White and even Jesse continues to call him that throughout their fraught and lethal relationship. Well its either that or 'bitch'.  Characterisation is everything and this series really does develop each of the main contenders.  But Walter is the star. We admire his intellect and sympathise with his plight as an underachieving chemistry teacher at odds with his financial failure, while his contempories make it rich. The effort to make extra income from the car wash and the humiliating embarrassment that this brings serves to remind us of our own failures and shortcomings.  But we don't turn to crime and attempt to lessen the impact on our consciences by lieing to all our loved ones as well as ourselves. This is what Walter does and it gets deeper and deeper, darker and darker until you begin to realise that his position at any given time in the series is unpredictable as well as the velocity or pace at which he moves. Heisenberg is a brilliant alias for Walter.  Part of you wants Walter to succeed, because of his at first, apparent motives for doing so.  He is dieing of cancer and wants (not needs) to leave his family with financial security, given that his son has cerebral palsy and his wife Skyler is expecting a child and him just turned fifty. His disarming, calm and slightly diffident manner along with his well known illness make him perfect for getting under the radar of DEA and police.  The spiral of decline into drug crime, drags everyone he loves along with him until all are tainted directly or indirectly with the sad immorality of human weakness - desire, greed, hate, envy, lust and total lack of any consideration for others. Being responsible for the consequences of your actions is a huge part of the philosophy of utilitarianism that underlies much of American values and in this series the writers have provided us with a brilliant ambivilance to this as represented in the hero/villain Walter. The knock on effect of his actions are interwoven so well -  the flight control officer, whose daughter Walter watches choke to death on her own vomit, is so affected by this trajedy that he ends up being responsible for a mid air collision, killing hundreds. Then we see Walter reluctantly addressing the whole school about the issue as part of a group therapy where everyone in Albuquerque has been seen in need of counselling. Walter tells everyone that there is still a positive side to this trajedy -  'it is only the 53rd worse air crash in history' ! It is really bleak at times - but it is also very funny.  The hitman for the drug boss is seen returning his lovely grandchildren back to their mummy in their beautiful middle class home where they are encouraged to say bye bye to 'pop pop'  - not grandpa or grandpappy. The very next scene we see him shooting three Mexican drug adversaries - 'pop' 'pop' 'pop' ! Just like that.  It is excellent acting by the cast, the New Mexico desert and townscapes provide room for escape, the study in evil, the tragi-comic script, tension and audience participation where you feel you can make the decisions, good or bad, on behalf of Walter.  I read somewhere where it was called a 'dramedy', a new genre of Tv movie.  It is great entertainment - and you will not regret entering the quantum world of Walter White.

  This is truly great television - it's /almost/ on a par with The Wire. Great characters, great acting, and a tight and credible script that's real and unreal at once.  It's the story of a regular person just like you and I who descends (or is it ascends - the piece is wilful about its moral ambiguity) at a vertiginous rate to criminal existence of unimaginable horror and yet wonder, while at once facing an entirely ordinary home and work life, a life seared by his bitter, Damocletian cancer. It's at points frightening, heartwarming, exciting, and black (no, really black) humoured. The darkest part is the part at which I laughed the loudest. Like the best drama, it's human light in dark places. You should buy this.So why doesn't ""truly great television"" deserve five stars?  The trouble is that that the first season, shortened by the Hollywood writers' strike, is only seven episodes. Subsequent series are 13 episodes, or 16. So Season One is really a half season, and the price /should/ (but, as I write, doesn't) fairly reflect that.  On loading disk 3 (of 3) to play its single lonely episode I felt a little cheated. So buying just Season One is like dating a beautiful woman with a scintillating personality, only to have her leave your date half way through.  Just like all of Breaking Bad, it's a lovely agony.

  I bought this just to see what all the fuss was about.  However, I did not enjoy it at all.  Personal taste, this one is not for me.

  Like the Sopranos, The Wire, Spooks, Mad Men? This is for you, and it will take you to places you never knew existed behind the small screen. Without giving too much away, this dark, funny , violent, sad and gutwrenching story of good man goes bad is the best damn thing I have watched in a long long time. Completely compulsive. Suffice to say the best shows are the ones that explore their characters' ambivalent and conflicting hopes, dreams and desires. And this, as they say, is The One. Aidan

  Highly original and multifaceted drama.  Concerns the attempts of a brilliant chemistry teacher to cope with cancer, a poor personal financial situation, an imminent unplanned addition to the family, the astronomical costs of the US medical system, and dealing in drugs and with violent drug barons whilst having a gung-ho police officer for a brother-in-law, to mention but a few of the issues involved. Never a dull moment.  Difficult to resist the urge to watch episode after episode without a break.

  If you like the likes of Weeds, Californication, Sons of Anarchy, Mad Men,THIS USA HIT TV SHOW IS AN ABSOLUTELY MUST SEE.The second season has already aired in the USA so watch out for it on UK tvcome late April so no need to buy the second season if you get this AND WATCH IT NOW.Really adult, moving, funny, dark, excellent characters and plots and sub plots...and the Second season (I just completed watching it last night) JUST GETS BETTER!Get it, watch it!

  Eventually the buzz got to me and I decided to see for myself. The first episode was gripping, but from then I felt that the script writers were playing catch up with some slightly clunky plot openings and only by the last episode have things settled down. However, I'm now about to embark on series 2, so you can say I'm a believer.The cuts to black where they appear are annoying, but I'm not sure if these were for commercials or for dramatic effect. Actually the meth part of the story is the more gripping, but I can see the moral dilemmas piling up in the background for the other family members, so I expect more from them in Series 2.

  This series was suggested to me by a relative who had watched all of the available series (1-4 at the time). I had never heard of it despite it being aired in the UK and available on DVD here as well. Having wwatched it, and seen how brilliant it is, I am suprised at how unknown it is in the UK. A very well thought out plot with excellent acting from Bryan Cranston and the rest of the cast. I have now watched all four series and the show has just got better and better. The layers of plotting and the character arcs, especially those of Cranston and Aaron Paul, keep getting more and more intricate and fraught. It also steers away from episodic storylines and maintains a continual story arc, involving all of the characters, throughout it's entire run so far. Well worth a watch, especially at the low cost it is currently available for. Thoroughly recommended.
",5
"
  I won't ramble on. This series is just utterly brilliant, in every way. Characters, plot, script, acting, camera and soundtrack - awesome. I can't wait to get to the end so that I can watch it all again.Watch it now.PS unfortunate marketing rip-off divides the final season into two 8-episode ""seasons"", each costing the same as a full 13-episode season.But it's so good I almost didn’t mind.
",5
"
  Such a good series to watch.  Dark comedy and drama rolled into one.  Delivery and packaging were up to usual Amazon standards - no complaints from me!
",5
"
  Couldn't really see what all the fuss was about, highly implausible storylines. This quiet, law-abiding guy accidentally kills two people (villains admittedly) in the course of illegal drug making activities and hardly bats an eyelid! Won't bother with the remaining seasons.

"
  This wonderful show urged me to quit my job in Tescos and set up my own crystal meth business, all was well until my grandmother got arrested in boots trying to buy 35 packets of sudofed which subsequently resulted in our static caravan being raided by the flying squad. I thought I was cool and I would be the 'one who knocks'.....turned out it was chief inspector Mulligan who did the knocking and I now write this from my cell in Pentonville.

  Question for yourself : your wife is pregnant, your son partially disabled and you are a teacher for chemistry, not exactly a millionaire... You are diagnosed with cancer... How would you try to make as much money as possible ???the answer is easy: just become a producer of drugs !This series made us laugh and cry, its really comical,brutal as well as exciting and i would recommend it to everyone who likes a mix of drama and comedy.
",5
"
  Well worth a watch! This is a clear demonstration of the abilty of some US TV series to be far more than the bland pap that many people expect. Focussed on a relatively small cast, all excellent players. This drama has a lot to say about real life, as experienced by large numbers of people. A great sense of humour surrounds the delivery of the story which twists and turns in a way I found satisfying. The central pairing of characters is beautifully done: think Bronson and Mifune in ""Red Sun"", Culp and Cosby in ""Hickey and Boggs"", Nolte and Short in ""Three Fugitives"" or Belzer and Beatty in ""Homicide Life on the Street""If you're sqeamish about ""real"" life and prefer the Disney version, this may not be for you.

"
  Ater years of hearing people rave about this series, I found the first series okay and varied from quirky off the wall to a soap opera.I won't be bothering the other 4 series.

"
  What would you do? You're a chemistry teacher on a teacher's salary, told from out of the blue that you have lung cancer with only a short life-span remaining. You have a wife and a teenage but crippled son, and another baby due. The cost of your treatment runs into the tens of thousands, and you don't want your family to suffer under excrutiating debt when you're gone. Well, you start making crystal meth! Any other details would act as spoilers, but the twists and turns are ingeniously interwoven, helped by the acting. And all 3 series are excellent, riveting to watch. Finally, the teacher's brother in law is DEA! I can hardly wait until July,when series 4 goes into production! Absolutely brilliant. Amendment as of 28/11, have now seen series 4 thanks to a friend with tivo, it just gets better! Series 4  has won the most awards apparently, and I can see why. Need to see series 5, can hardly wait!! It's going to consist of 16 episodes and will be the last, but I suppose terminal cancer has it's limits(!). It'd be funny (peculiar) if he doesn't die, although my sympathies lie with him and in a way it'd be nice if he rode off into the sunset, as it were.

  I saw this on Amazon and liked the sound of it. I've enjoyed the Sopranos, most of 24 and Mad Men. I didn't think that I'd ever enjoy anything as much as the Sopranos but this has just grabbed me straight away. I can't wait for season 2. There's some humour as well as some heart searching stuff and although what walt's doing is wrong the audience can understand why and totally root for him. I'm just so sick that I've finished the 1st season!
",5
"
  after 'the sopranos' this is probably the best series on tv - maybe ever. it asks all sorts of questions about moral absolutes- doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, etc, and all the consequences of that. a series with real depth and scope. fantastic acting! i loved bryan cranston in malcolm in the middle, but here he really shows what he can do. some imaginative framing of shots too, as in the sopranos. lots of twists and surprises/shocks. excellent writing. can't praise it enough.
",5
"
  Watch this! Watch this with an open mind and it is one of the most touching and darkly amusing but essentially entertaining series you could ever find.  I am completely gripped, Walt is a wonderfully written and portrayed character and I think I've developed a bit of a crush quite frankly...  What else can I say? This is so original and, I believe, just so well put together - you care about what happens even though you know it'll be bad, One thing - and I know what I'm talking about - the double-speak of oncologists is captured perfectly. Can't wait to see season 2...Cannot understand anyone giving this less than 5 stars.

  I started watching Breaking Bad after constant nagging from my fifteen year old son and his friends.  I am now at the end of Season 4 and don't know what I'm going to do when it's finished.  (Probably start watching them over again..)  Other reviewers have covered so much of why this is such an amazing show so I'll just say that I can't remember watching anything so compelling, with such depth of character, and where every time you think you know what's going to happen, they pull the rug from under your feet. Watching BB has been a roller coaster ride - I have had my head in my hands, peered through my fingers in disbelief, shouted at the TV, and cried.  Why this show has not been available on terrestrial TV in the UK remains a huge mystery and shows that TV companies can make mistakes like the rest of us.  Breaking Bad doesn't pull any punches and has a clear message about drugs.  I welcomed the discussions it opened up with my son.  BRILLIANT - buy it!
",5
"
  As I too suffer from cancer, I found the story line of particular interest. Roughly, the man is a senior lab technician in the drug industry. When he discovers he has incurable cancer he goes into partnership with a street dealer so as to leave his wife and children with no financial worries. But all without their knowledge. Great casting, locations, script etc.
",5
"
  This was recommended to me as being 'The best thing ever on TV'. I must have had it for a few months & then one mouldy afternoon decided to watch an episode to see what it was like. Got completely hooked & then ordered the box set of the entire thing & fir a while it was just about all that was watched. Unbelievably brilliant - it just kept getting better.
",5

  Bought this as a gift as I have previously seen the series and wanted to share the enjoyment. It does not disappoint. The acting is fantastic. The story original. The end of each episode leaves you wanting more. Expect to spend more money as you will want the other seasons. Highly recommended.

  I bought series 1 having read the reviews, just to see if I liked it. I watched it and loved the intelligent humour and the whole storyline of a High School Chemistry teacher getting into such a corner that he feels the only way out of his financial problems is to cook ctystal meth with a high school drop-out who is actually really really funny. Many of the characters, from Walter the High School teacher, his son Walt Jnr and his DEA brother-in-law and radiologist sister-in-law are just such wondreful characters and, of course, there is the underlying issue of Walter having cancer and his thoughts about what to do about it, and everybody else's thoughts about what he should do about it. It is a really entertaining, intelligently written, funny (and in some places very dark) series and one that I would highly recommend. I am going to order the next couple of series without a doubt.

  The Whole of the Breaking Bad Series are very good and it is great to see how the actors evole from the start to the finish of the Series, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are brilliant in the leads for these roles and they have a great supporting cast.having watched all season I cant wait to see what happens in the spin off Series

  Sure, I could spread some lyrical wax about how good the shows were and how it'll be some time before we see something as good again. It'd be truthful, yeah? 'Course it would!Thankfully, for anyone reading this, better people have already praised these DVD sets so I don't have to.

  You will love this amazing show if:- You like tv series that treat you like an adult- you like character driven shows- you like slow burners.... that ultimately pay off big style!- you usually don't watch TV as everything on it is Guff.... well this isn't!This is the crescendo of my journey through decent tv series e.g. The Wire; Deadwood; firefly... breaking bad. Bryan Cranston's (main character) descent from happily married man to drugs kingpin is awesome, riveting and believable... that's they key word here.. believable. Buy it now.... now.. top corner press the button... and i would think about the next series soon as I expect, like me, you'll watch the first series in a couple of days... you have been warned. Enjoy.

  We were recommended this series after hearing a few good things about it. From the start we were hooked, it's a fantastic series that is extremely well written and well acted, especially Bryan Cranston (the lead) who has won many awards for his role. I HIGHYLY recommend this series, it will keep you wanting more and more as it is just that good. Without a doubt in my top five series of all time, and easily in the top three. Season two was hastily ordered after this season finished and doesn't dissapoint at all, it only gets better.

  dark,original and outstanding - credit to the producers for getting it released  - let alone financed.it's not a fun ride but the series' acting and it's premise are jaw dropping through every shocking episode.however the dramatic situations and occasional extreme violence - not everyone's cup of tea - may leave you depressed and thoughtful.
",5
"
  I feel a little guilty sometimes at not rating products I buy on Amazon often enough - it would be a sin not to pass comment on this one on though.It is, simply, the best TV drama I have ever seen - think The Wire multiplied by The Soprano's to the power of 17, it really is that good.Order series 1 & 2 at the same time before heading over to Amazon.de to order series 3,[...]strangely enough Amazon.co.uk don't have it yet.

  A fast moving, brilliant film with many powerful and unexpected twists and turns. Deep insight into people, very profound and very funny. My friends and I love it - many became addicted to it and some have watched it twice with even greater enjoyment the second time. I will in years to come look forward to watching it all again.

  For every Breaking Bad fan, it is essential that they own at least a copy of every season. And why not go Blu-Ray to add that extra visual quality to the experience.
",5

  This DVD is a great introduction to a series that just keeps getting darker and more interesting with each season.  You don't want to like the main characters, 'cos they are technically so morally wrong, but the writing is so great you can't help yourself and you end up on their side (at least I did). The whole series really looks at how nothing in life is ever black or white, just varying shades of grey, and how all our decisions have consequences.  It is very perceptive, moving at times, shocking in parts and sometimes even funny.  I can't stop watching it and am now half-way through season 3.  This is up there with Mad Men and The Sopranos - buy it if you appreciate great writing, acting and unconventional story lines.

  My boyfriend and I are addicted to this series! He loved this present so much that he went straight out after we'd completed the first series and brought the whole collection! Brilliant acting and storyline :]

  To say more on what I mean by the title, I think this is one of the best opening seasons of any show I have seen for a long time. I remember I started watching this around the same time a few other good shows, however this show still has my interest where others have failed to keep it.Dark, gripping and original!

  Fantastic season

  Warning: Breaking Bad is highly addictive. You will ignore your friends, your job and whatever else is going on in your life, whilst ever there is one more episode in the DVD box to watch. So the best thing to do is get stuck into Season 1,2 and 3 and hang out on the street corner, screaming out across the Atlantic, ""Yo, bring on Season 4, B%?*ch!!""
",5
"
  This series has reinvigorated my interest in TV drama. It has to be the best series I've seen since the Sopranos, not that this is really anything like it except that it has a very likeable central character, who is compelled to do reprehensible things to provide a future for his family. It's funny, tragic, exciting, poignant, dramatic, frightening and has nerve twisting tension that becomes almost unbearable. The best thing about it, apart from the beautiful central performance by Bryan Cranston, is the pure unflinching logic of the script. This is a show that makes owning a TV very worthwhile.

  Was absolutely hooked straight away.  Couldn't stop watching it - found it difficult to watch any other programmes.  Heard it recommended on the radio too.  Saw the actors on Graham Norton's show.

  The premise of the story doesn't sound like it would grab you, but by episode 3 we were hooked.  We set ourselves up to watch an episode a night, but it's not possible, you can't help but say ""oh just one more"",  The best thing on T.V. and you will not be disappointed.

  We are absolutely loving this - it has to be the best DVD series ever. We have just finished season 4 and can't wait for series 5 (in the post) and the finale (on it's way at the end of November) to pop through the letterbox.  Our only worry is what will we do when it's finished?!

  It's all been said before. If you have never seen it,.. do so !

  If you like the Wire, Shield, Sopranos you are very likely to enjoy this (it's second only to the Wire for me). But even if you don't you may enjoy it, it's hard hitting, but fun which is tricky to do. Plus it's not a brain acher - you can sit back with a beverage (a beer or cuppa tea maybe) and you can relax and watch it. Anyone that has spoke to me about it has enjoyed it.

  99% of people I speak to will agree that Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows they have watched. Each series takes on a slightly different 'flavour', and are all worth 4 or 5 stars but arguably season one is the best because the concept is fresh and what the protagonist is going through is more raw.

  If you missed seeing this on TV then buy this DVD!  This series is brilliantly executed from the writing, editing, location and fantastic acting.

  I have well and truly became a big fan of ""Breaking Bad' although at first i thought it got off to a slow start, it became clear very quickly that the ""pace"" of the action was a great 'hook' to grab a long and protracted view needed to absorb the black tragi/comedy unfolding before your eyes, in-fact it is precisely that fine line trod between ""tragic/comedic quality that is so compelling about this drama...... watch it and get Hooked  !:-)

  I bought this after reading about Breaking Bad at Den of Geek. This started an addiction which meant having to subscribe to Netflix. Watched the last episode the day after it was broadcast. Simply the best thing I've ever seen on TV.
",5
"
  I bought this for a friend as I wanted to share my enjoyment of what has got to be the best series ever. Breaking Bad is excellent and totally addictive, all seasons have really delivered and I can't wait for the next one.
",5
"
  Very enjoyable series but does get very grim on occasion but that just serves to remind the viewer that the subject matter is serious.
",5
"
  A truly excellent TV series, a brilliant example of modern television story telling, funnily enough I have heard that this is actually the weakest of the seasons, and as such I cannot wait to see season 2.
",4
"
  Having only watched the pilot episode so far I can already appreciate why this series became such a hit. Will write a more informed review after watching the rest of the series.
",4
"
  Wow gosh crikey and crumbs this is a humdinger of a series. Edge of the seat and bite all your fingernails off! Excellent acting, filming, and writing. Buy it, watch it, become addicted to it.
",5
"
  Excellent product.
",5
"
  The introduction was interesting but I did not like Season 1 too much. There were some funny parts and this made it better. I would not recommend to anyone.
",3
"
  This is one of the best series I have ever seen. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman rock !!Brilliant, even though at first I wasn't keen on just reading the synopsis, so very glad I watched it. Highly recommend.
",5
"
  GREAT GREAT  GREAT LOVE THE WHOLE SERIES KEPTED US UP ALL NIGHT LOVED THE BLACK HUMOUR AND THE PLOTSPat B
",5
"
  What more can I say? If you haven't seen this, watch it! I'm buying this for my parents, because they need to watch it. Heisenberg and Jesse Pinkman have already cemented themselves as TV legends - The Sopranos, eat your heart out.
",5
"
  A very unusual TV serial which was superbly made and acted. The only criticism I have of it is that some  scenes were  a bit long-winded and did not progress the story very much. Will certainly get the follow-up episodes.
",4
"
  BB is amazing. If you haven't watched it - why not?
",5
"
  I enjoyed watching this show, however, I don't understand the hype it gets. In my opinion, it really isn't that great!
",3
"
  Very Happy !!!! :)
",5
"
  Outstanding, borrowed the rest of the series, on Series 4 now, taking a slow as I do not want it to end.  It's fantastic.
",5
"
  I've seen Bryan Cranston in a few things and enjoyed his performances and it was my son (age 22) who put me on to this series.  We watched this consecutive nights and, thanks to a friend giving him more disks as a gift, have already seen series 2.  It is dark stuff, but so incredibly, faultlessly performed and put together that I regret seeing it only because I will never have the pleasure of coming back 'new' to it again.  Brilliant.
",5
"
  i had not heard of this series but was looking for something my husband and i could watch together after working our way through all the madmen series. this is a compelling and original series. we are both constantly delighted by the unpredictability of breaking bad. we are onto series 2 now!
",5
"
  all i can say is buy it! you cant watch this on uk tv for some reason but its much better in my blu ray player with the surround sound on anyway, this is just the start, theres 4 more series and it just gets better and better
",5
"
  I bought this as it was recommended to me. I was not disappointed.  My 20 year old son watched it all in one sitting practically.  He said it was one of the best series he has watched.  Truly great viewing.  So I am passing on the recommendation...................
",5
"
  This is as amazing as the hype, the characters, actors, plotline, humour, in fact everything about it.
",5
"
  taking a while to get in to it. But it works perfectly in my DVD player. Its not the product its the content. Not there yet
",3
"
  This is a great show and I really enjoyed the first series on DVD but now I am watching the subsequent series on netflix.The process and delivery of the DVD was super smooth with now problems at all
",5
"
  The ultimate boxset - the best TV in years
",5
"
  We heard from a friend this was actually good.  We weren't sure but we gave it a o and got hooked... 2 weeks and three seasons later we are spreading the word.
",5
"
  This was so good I bought the whole series after
",5
"
  Why did I not hear about this series before its beautifully filmed the acting is superb and the story line is both novel and very edgy.......you MUST see this and this is only series 1 of 5
",5
"
  Seriously this exists out there and we get Glee and another series of Big Brother?Funny, serious, entertaining, brilliant acting, great plot - Overall one of the best TV series written.Just be glad it's out on DVD and available from Amazon, curl up on the settee and enjoy.
",5
"
  This is the best Series I have ever seen, It has everything and twists and turns in every episode. The actors/characters are simply the best and I can't wait to see the final 8 episodes. Love, love ,love it !!!!!
",5
"
  Thank you five stars ✨
",5
"
  Totally brilliant.  Buy rest of seriesEverything about this is excellentHooked once you start watchingDeserves all the praise given
",5
"
  If you have not see this yet then you are in for a treat. Not for the squeamish though.
",5
"
  This is one of my favourite series and Bryan Cranston is excellent in it. So many twists and turns in the plot and you never know what will happen next and how the main characters survive!!!!
",5
"
  Really great TV show. Very funny at times. 1st episode is fantastic then it slows down a bit to set the scene (don't let this put you off) it soon picks up again. have recommended to everyone I know
",5
"
  It is what it is. Brilliant. No real need to elaborate. If you liked it on TV, you'll still like it. If you didn't see, prepare to get immersed.
",5
"
  I bought this without reading anything about it. I total didn't know what to think about this TV show until i watched it. And all I can say is that its amazing. From start to finish it kept me hooked and wanting more. The only down side about this show is that its only 6 episodes long. I have already told people about it after buying and watching it all on Thursday. Cant' wait to get my hands on the 2nd season and hope its just as great
",5
"
  After being forced to sit through the whole box set of Dexter this is a pleasant surprise.  Very good plot, occasionally funny, occasionally sad, believable - hooked from episode 1
",5
"
  Good series, some episodes are a bit slow but it still got me hooked
",4
"
  This series has been rightly lauded by almost everyone.  Definitely worth watching and unlike other US series there are not an overwhelming number of episodes in each season.
",4
"
  fantastic gem of a series - great story that keeps you gripped. remarkable performances by the two leads. Had to buy series 2, just as good. Can't wait for series 3 to be released. amazon - great price, great delivery
",5
"
  This is a great TV series, at least in my mind. I love that you see what happens when someone ends up on the edge of everything and then starts breaking the law :)
",5
"
  not bad,but will not be buying season 2
",3
"
  Thank you
",5
"
  amazing series
",5
"
  I recently watched Damages all 5 series and wanted something to replace it.  I was recommended BB bya work collegue and therefore purchased series one. I have since purchased 2 & 3 !!!Really different drama series with a bit of dry comedy here and there.Cranston is really brilliant and i love the way the character has developed.Great Stuff
",5
"
  Would definitely recommend this.  I was surprised how much dark comedy is in this. It doesn't really end and so will move on to the next series now!
",5
"
  Wow! what an opening episode to this amazing series.Why this hasn't been on British TV I don't know..Its pretty unique in being exciting funny touching and heavy.. Don't hesitate and get stuck in!!
",5
"
  Donut derstand all the hype.  An ok programme nothing to write home about.
",3
"
  And it is absolutely brilliant.Laugh out loud dark humour, reminded me of Little Miss Sunshine.Can't wait to get the rest.
",5
"
  Not worth the hype. If we hadn't have received the complete box set as a gift, we wouldn't have bothered watching the remaining series.
",3
"
  Excellent introduction to the world of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, etc...in just one word - superb!! Only criticism is that Season 1 is not long enough!!!
",5
"
  Takes you into a whole different world that you had heard about but never understood Chemistry on an industrial level BRILLIANT !
",5
"
  Could not stop watching! Tried to limit time spent but compulsive viewing, all my colleagues at work would speculate where the next episode would take us, you just could not tell.
",5
"
  good price and great watching. would definately reccomend to others but beware you may lose many many hours of your life. reccomended seller.
",5
"
  Bought off the back of a recommendation.Wasn't sure about the story line at first but this really works. Good mix of serious, a little bit of comedy and action.Ready for season 2 now
",5
"
  fab
",5
"
  Simply the best series ever. I bought this as a secret santa present for a friend who hasn't seen the series, great value, anyone who has heard the hype should check this out!
",5
"
  Am grateful to the person for suggesting I try this series. It has drama, pathos and a great deal of black humour.lookmforward to recommending it to many more people.
",5
"
  FANTASTIC ORIGINAL STORYLINE, CAN'T STOP WATCHING THIS AND CANT WAIT FOR MORE. DON'T MISS IT FROM THE START. ( Season 1 ) . . . BRILLIANT. . .  A REAL FIVE STAR SERIES, PROMISE YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED, Love it.
",5
"
  Would definitely recommend watching this series. Original, humourous, well crafted and nuanced performances from a terrific cast. Bryan Cranston is amazing!
",5
"
  Great value for money could not buy this any cheaper anywhere else for this quality of dvdv
",5
"
  Series 1 with great humour, gives a great start to a great series, a must see experience, do watch, you could be hooked too.
",5
"
  highly recommend, each season just keeps getting better ..now that i have seen them all , how do i fill the empty void ?
",5
"
  Best series i've ever watched. If you're looking for a new show to start watching then Breaking Bad is the best one out there.
",5
"
  A great series which is quirky. A bit reminiscent of Dexter. People get killed yet there are lots of laughs. I am looking forward to the next series.
",5
"
  Excellent service, no problems. Plus it was everything it has been hyped up to be. Must see DVD. I know, I know it's been around for ages...but better late than never.
",5
"
  Thoroughly enjoyed the First Season of Breaking Bad.  Unlike many other series it held our attention from the start.  Filled in some dire nights on the T.V.  An amusing story line.  Highly unlikely, but definitely holds your interest.  Beats the run of the mill Rom Com hands down.
",5
"
  Everyone loves this show for a reason. Slow start but you need it as Walts life starts to blow out of control,
",5
"
  Really intelligent drama, great entertainment. No car crashes, No car chases, and no shoutouts. Seriously brilliant and thought provoking, Tops.
",5
"
  We bought this DVD for holiday entertainment.  It is very funny in parts  but VERY violent in others. We will probably buy the next series.
",4
"
  I found the first season a little slow , however i stuck with it and i am into season 3 now - recommened viewing.Well acted .
",5
"
  Brought as gift for friend , great price and fast delivery
",5
"
  I'm hooked!! Got this DVD to see if the show was any good, I liked so much I bought the complete box set!
",5
"
  This original and outstanding series had me hooked from the first scene.Bryan Cranston deservidly won an Emmy for his performance ,and the writing is just superb,dark,outragous and very funny at times.It actually plays out as metaphor for what's happening in small town america and if anyone wants to read up on the bare ,cold hard facts then read METHLAND by Nick Reding.
",5
"
  Great value for money!
",5
"
  Best TV series ever highly recommend to everyone to buy all of the seasons, gripping action and storyline that will keep you in front of the tv for hours!
",5
"
  BB gets off to a flying start, drops a little in tempo, but it reels you in and is destined to be classic viewing.
",5
"
  Bought this floor my son in law as I couldn't part with my copy. Would recommend it to anyone with a dark sense of humour.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever put on TV, for a subject matter that is far from pleasant this show packs in tons of laughs!
",5
"
  Excellent
",5
"
  Great
",5
"
  My husband loved this series so the DVDS were a huge success
",5
"
  such a good show  ,I brought for my hubby for Christmas as he watched it on TV and was hooked, I watched them now and its great.
",5
"
  Really entertaining
",5
"
  To get some of my family and friends to watch, I've had to blackmail them to by buying it for them..
",5
"
  This series does't grab you by the scruff of the neck in the first episode but develops into an intelligently sculpted story with great dialogue, acting and brilliant writing. A DEFINITE 'MUST SEE.'
",5
"
  Brought this for my son but got totally hooked within the first 10 mins. .!! Can not recommended this series highly enough !
",5
"
  Incredible TV but get the full boxset
",5
"
  This series one box set has been great value for money we found if  to be very funny and entertaining.
",4
"
  My only regret was not going for the box set of all four series. The acting is excellent and the storyline is very compelling.
",5
"
  Great series just wish did a box set containing  all seasons was available would recommend series this is such good viewing
",5
"
  very good
",5
"
  Great item and delivered really quick, thank you
",5
"
  The picture breaks up and pixelated quite a few times through all episodes.Colour contrast faded on face close ups.
",3
"
  Breaking Bad ... what can I say?  It's absolutely BRILLIANT - one of the best series I've watched.  Now on series 3 and can hardly WAIT for series 4. Superb storyline and superb acting.Drew.
",5
"
  Season 1 and 2 are very good, but season 3, 4 and 5 make this one of, if not the best thing I have watched in a long time
",5
"
  One of the best series I`ve watched.. Waiting for series 6 !
",5
"
  Bought this after seeing in the news that the last episode was being shown. First season is brilliant in every way. 2nd season already ordered :)
",5
"
  I'm sure I'm not the first to say it. I think this is the best TV show I have ever seen. Some people say series one is slow, but I was hooked from the first episode! In any case, everyone is pretty much agreed that it just gets better and better the further on you get.
",5
"
  It's breaking bad. Need I say more!
",5
"
  we like the program quite a bit and are deeply involved in our binge watching.  The plot changes and is entertaining.
",5
"
  Enjoyed this series despite mixed reviews from friends. Looking forward to series 2.
",4
"
  Brilliant black drama comedy and great condition and price
",5
"
  Just when you think this series cant go any further it brings in another twist.  Cant bear to think it will ever end!
",5
"
  I won't spoil it for the uninitiated.  Season One of this cult TV show will have you hooked and each season gets better and better
",5
"
  It is Breaking all Good series into Bad pieces.
",5
"
  Bought this because I had seen it on tv and my boyfriend had'nt. Original concept, great acting,marvellous! Getting all 5 series
",5
"
  love this series, bryan cranston plays the part amazingly well. if you havnt seen this i would recommend it highly.
",5
"
  Delivered on time, perfect
",5
"
  Bought this after hearing so much about Breaking Bad, was not disappointed.Can't think of a single thing to mark it down so I gave it 5 stars.Brilliantly acted and well written, absolutely hooked now, can't wait to watch the other 4 seasons.
",5
"
  Love Breaking bad, if you not seen it, stop thinking and buy it
",5
"
  By far the best tv show I have ever seen. But beware it takes over your life!
",5
"
  Well most people know by now how brilliant BB is - and we're completely hooked. Don't know what we'll do when it's finished.
",5
"
  Excellent product, excellent series.
",5
"
  I have only watched the 2 episodes so far. Thought it was going to be serious but it is so funny I laughed out loud.
",5
"
  If you didn't like trainspotting - the movie not the ""ahem"" sport then don't buy this. If you think there could not possibly be anything funny about methamphetamine, then don't buy this. But if you like black comedy, superb acting, intelligent social comment and watching a slightly doughy man in tighty whities this is the series for you. My only complaint was there were not enough episodes.
",5
"
  Great series and I look forward to the following series
",5
"
  Couldnt get into it

"
  Very good and arrived on time

  I thought the sopranos was good but this is just as good .I have also watched Breaking Bad two and it is also very good
",5
"
  Hi very dark storyline, and very funny at times so very enjoyable and now I want to watch the rest of the series
",4
"
  Brilliant series this, I think I will watch series one through again before getting series two ordered. Got it at a good price and was delivered quickly.
",5
"
  This is worth a look.  It does start off slowly but it gets you gripped and I would strongly recommend this series.  A classic.
",5
"
  I have bought this for a present for a friend who hasn't seen the show. I have dvd box set and this is definitely worth watching.
",5
"
  Breaking Bad is totally amazing!!! full of drugs, gore, comedy ... its a must see and I can't wait till the 2nd series is out next month :)
",5
"
  Ok
",5
"
  The DVD arrived on time.  It was well packaged and reasonably priced.  It was a good buy and I would use this company again.
",5
"
  Best thing I have ever watched.
",5
"
  Excellent service highly recommend
",5
"
  Taking me a long while to get in to this - have bought season two in case I decide to continue with it
",3
"
  Good product, fast service.
",5
"
  What a great series, for anyone who says otherwise is either very sad or is a troll, great storyline, great acting.
",5
"
  Excellent!!!!  Seller got this to me in superfast time
",5
"
  Only watched three episodes so far but I love it. Walter and Jessie, what a double act! Can't wait to get engrossed in all of the seasons.
",5
"
  Excellent series, humour and serious, very good balance.
",5
"
  Heard so much about this series and when I realised it was being shown on T.V I had already missed the 1st series hence the purchase. Was not dissappointed. Great.
",5
"
  Amazing series, would highly recommend. I have already watched Season 2 and can't wait to get season 3 and onwards
",5
"
  I will return to watch this again and again.
",5
"
  I like many am accustomed to the brilliance of shows like The Wire, The Sopranos etc but this unexpected gem is up there with them.  The storyline is unusual but ultimately believable and the plotting, acting, irony and comedy are compulsive.  Just watch once and you, like some of those involved, will be hooked.
",5
"
  Very pleased
",5
"
  Excellent value and very fast dispatch
",5
"
  This was a gift though I haven't watched it myself my son loved it!
",5
"
  VERY GOOD
",5
"
  I am sure this is great. I don't know as I bought it for a friend. I hope he will lend it to me.
",5
"
  Buy this - get into it and buy all of the box sets - you will love it.
",5
"
  HBO have done it again. Another great television series from the best programme makers of the decade. The narrative is never predictable and having it on DVD allows you to watch it (again and again) at leisure.Cannot wait for series 2 and 3 to be released
",5
"
  Hard to get into but ok , not sure about the rest of the series
",4
"
  Fantasic carnt wait for the next season to arrive

  I think I've already reviewed this. Superb series, got me hooked!

  One of the best series ever! I was hooked! It spared me from watching bad TV for a while!

  Excellent product would highly recommend, no problems with any delivery or technical problemsI would recommend this product to anyone
",5
"
  Bought as a present
",5
"
  My brother recommended this to me and I bought it for my mums birthday. It wasn't quite what we'd expected it to be as it started quite slowly and was quite dark, humour wise. But on reaching the end of the first season I absolutely love it and can't wait to watch the 2nd and 3rd seasons.
",5
"
  Best series ever
",5
"
  This series is so unusual in quality concerning; the main character, the script and the topic compared to the average TV series. I my opinion the quality is comparable with two of my favourites ever ""The Sopranos"" and ""Six feet under"".I bought this ""season 1"" TV series because a Dutch newspaper wrote a very friendly review. That review should have been far more enthusiastic.
",5
"
  Enjoyed Season 1 - will be purchasing the other seasons on the back of this.
",4
"
  Amazing show, read all the reviews, but come on Amazon, where is series 3? Series 4 is nearly finishing on air in the US. This is a phenomenal show so please use you powers to get an EU/UK launch. I don't know how but apparently they improve on these 1st 2 series.
",5
"
  Came next day, happy with purchase!

  Best series ever, bought for a friend, and she loved it

  Watch it - you'll get hooked!Can't recommend this highly enough!Bets programme I've ever seen.Get it now!!!Now!

  Came to this series rather late, got to say its one of the best series to come out of America.First 2 episodes are quite slow but it is setting the tone, I'm on series 5 at the minute and can't rate it highly enough.
",5
"
  I first heard about this on the Rooster teeth podcast, then asking friends they said that they all watched it as well, so I thought i would give it a shot. It has been an amazing series and I am now awaiting delivery of Season 2!!I recommend to anyone who likes comedy, drama or just some plain butt kicking action.
",5
"
  I've never reviewed a series before, but I enjoyed this one so much that I've decided to review it. The plot's already been laid out in earlier reviews so I'll just say that if you like The Wire, The Sopranos, 24 and Dexter (all of which i think are TOP TOP quality series) then I think you'll really enjoy this. I think it's easily on a par.
",5
"
  Great series's on season three already once you watch one episode you have to watch the next.
",5
"
  Very entertaining. Just need more. :-)
",5
"
  This series was recommended to me by my daughters.. and I haven't been disappointed by a single episode. Now watching season three and still enjoying it. Well worth watching.

  The storyline is fantastic. Breaking bad is so cleverly written. Truly addictive and a real treat as a box set.

  From speaking to people I found a mixed reception for this series. However, fortunately I listened to the 'hype' and purchased the series blind.It's a slow burner but the story is excellent and the acting supreme. Give it time and I am sure you love it.

  A US chemistry teacher (Bryan Cranston, fom 'Malcolm in the Middle') discovers he has cancer, and has no way of paying the medical bills. One day it occurs to him that he could cover the needed expenses by making Crystal Meth - a drug which is in high demand on the streets. The series follows his adventures, and the ever-increasingly tangled web of lies that he weaves.I've got to say how much I LOVED this series - season 1 is relatively short (7 episodes), but is filled with the kind of high-tension drama that made 'The Wire' so compelling. It's created by Vince Gilligan (the man behind 'The X-Files'), and has the same quirky humour threaded all the way through - aided immensely by Cranston's witheringly caustic portrayal of a man who does not suffer fools gladly AT ALL, but ends up having to work with one.As events unfurl, he is forced to keep bigger and bigger secrets from his wife and son...I don't want to give the impression that this is primarily a comedy, because it isn't - it's a dark psychological drama with some great moments of equally dark humour - the cast are all exceptional, and the casting is spot-on. For example, Cranston's character has a son who has CP, so they cast RJ Mitte, an actor who actually has it in real life. This might seem a little worthy but when watching the series it works perfectly. From a serious perspective, as well as providing memorable moments of humour and pathos, it also offers an adult exploration of morality and ethics, and highlights the problems with the healthcare system in the US at the moment.If you liked the grittiness of 'The Wire', the dark humour of 'The Sopranos' or the strangle other-ness of 'The X-Files', I can recommend this to you WHOLEHEARTEDLY. Seriously - this is the best thing I've seen on TV for a long long time... and the good news is that series 2 is just as good, but 12 episodes long!Take a chance - buy it - I promise you won't regret it.European version out in a couple of weeks:

  Bryan Cranston is brilliant as chemistry teacher Walter White, at 50 his modest world in meltdown with news of terminal cancer.  From now on, he is obsessed with the need to provide for the family soon to be left behind - pregnant wife Skyler, cerebral palsy son.  How quickly to make money?  His chemical skills will be used to cook crystal - there are big killings (sadly, literally) to be made in the drug market.  He teams up with former pupil Jesse (Aaron Paul very good), but care needs to be taken - especially with a cop as brother-in-law.Politically correct?  Anything but!  Thanks to wincingly fine writing and acting, the series hooks.  Admittedly it is uncomfortable viewing, we sharing Walter's difficulties as he struggles to survive - his strength ebbing, body no longer to be trusted.  Hardly an appropriate setting for comedy, but there are laugh aloud moments as humour bursts through - most of it very black.  (Jesse - streetwise but otherwise a bit dim - learns the upstairs bath is NOT the best place to try dissolving a drug dealer's body in acid.)  It elates to see once so meek Walter now squaring up to those who annoy - turning on the bully who mocks his son's condition, taking revenge on the obnoxious yuppy who pinched his parking place, explosively confronting a psychotic drug baron.Seven 48 minute episodes.  Interesting extras (R.J. Mitte who plays the son also has cerebral palsy;  the crew all had their heads shaved when Walter did - to show solidarity).Unusual and arresting, attention grabbed from the start.  Wonderful scripts - witness Walter's cellar scenes with the captive dealer, that memorable family conference called to discuss his illness.  In view of Walter's supplying dangerous drugs, perhaps we should not care for him as much as we do.  The fact that we become so absorbed is the best possible tribute to all involved.

  Ich finde die Serie wunderbar und gut durchdacht, da sie mal was anderes bietet.Die Hauptbesetzung mit Bryan Cranston finde ich sehr stark. Er ist ein unglaublicher Schauspieler.Gleichermaßen muss man auch Vince Gilligan für die Idee und den Dreh danken. Ein krebskranker Chemielehrer will Geld durch die Herstellung von Meth ansparen um seine eigene Therapie wie auch den Rest des Lebens seiner Familie zu finanzieren.Ton/Musik und die Szenerie der einzelnen Episoden sind grandios.Die Serie balanciert Humor und Drama sehr gut und schafft es stets einen zu Packen. Ich springe von Episode zu Episode und kann fast nicht genug bekommen.Bei den schauspielerischen Leistungen gibt es natürlich etwas Diskrepanz. Die Hauptdarsteller sind wunderbar. Manche Nebendarsteller wirken etwas starr und unauthentisch, aber das ist meckern auf hohem Niveau.Was ich ebenfalls super finde ist, dass hier in der Serien (obwohl natürlich wegen ""Hollywood"" überspitzt dargestellt) die Handlungen (z.B. die Herstellungsprozesse) nachvollziehbar und realistischer dargestellt werden. Ich habe natürlich wenig Ahnung von Chemie, aber es scheint realistisch bzw. den Meth-Lab Berichte im Fernsehen nahe Erzählung.Erwartet aber nicht eine absolut realitätstreue Serie (*zwinker* In den nächsten Staffeln sieht es anders aus)Alles in allem ist Breaking Bad Staffel 1 eine wunderbare Serie, die von mir4/5 Sterne erhält.  Der letzte Stern fehlt, da die Serie erst gegen Mitte/Ende wirklich Fahrt aufnimmt. Das ist aber verständlich, da natürlich die Charaktere und die Situation aufgebaut und erklärt werden müssen und dies dauert in Serien etwas länger.

  Wow. Have just finished season 3. Can. not. WAIT to get my hands on season 4. Im not ususally a fan of US series (I have only seen the Sopranos and The Wire - both amazing) but this was recommended to me by a couple of friends - Id never heard of it and then I saw all the 5 star reviews on Amazon and I thought Id give it a go. Well, what can I say, this is one of the best tv series I have ever had the pleasure to view. It is so original and mental. Why the HELL has it not become bigger in the UK I do not know - I am still hopefull it will get the airing here it deserves and become more than a minor cult thing. I guess the subject matter (drugs and all the inherent dangers: ie taking them and manufactuing them etc) is perhaps a bit much for some.I know its been said 100 times already but the acting, cinematography, direction etc are all superb. It is everything you want from a tv show: darkly funny, edge of the seat moments, great chemistry between characters and just great characters in general. One week I like Hank best, the next its gotta be Saul (such a great great character that brings a little light relief to the darkness). And then theres the fact you are rooting for Jesse and Walt, basically 2 morally corrupt individuals! The only (small) problem I have had with it is the main female characters: all a bit annoying, weak and not big enough personalities...but hey ho you cant have everything (yes I am female).Anyway I dont want to give anything away though. Just watch this - and hopefully the more people in the UK that bang on about it the more chance someone somewhere in a scheduling dept at the TV channel will pull their finger out of their bottom and get it back on UK telly (I understand it jumped around on C5 and FX for a bit).WATCH THIS. You will not be disappointed.

  I rarely get hooked into US TV dramas, early Sopranos was probably my last major interest. Likewise, the majority of Hollywood films do little for me, because they tend to be predictable and/or rely on a formula, whilst strenuously avoiding any serious moral ambiguity. But ""Breaking Bad"" is so easy to enjoy precisely because it's unpredictable, darkly comic and frequently quite twisted. Full marks to the cable channel AMC for having the cojones to commission something like this. And zero marks to the main UK channels (other than Channel 5?) for failing to bring this to a wider audience over here.As the creator of the show (Vince Gilligan) has observed, there are no purely good or bad characters, and it's this continuous interplay of conflicting agendas which keeps you on the edge of your seat; at times it's excruciating to watch, in a very good and unusual way.The cinematography (shot on 35mm film) and searing desert locations are stunning. Because of the visual impact, lengthy edits and razor-sharp dialogue, it often feels like something by David Lynch, or Tarantino (on a good day). I'd even buy a Blu-Ray player just to get the very best version of this, if it wasn't for the fact that it's unavailable on Region B discs, and therefore requires an American machine! **Insert your own argument about the restrictive, artificial practices of the content industry here**I really hope this show has a long way to go (apparently Series 5 has just started shooting) but I somehow suspect that won't be the case...Also just found the ebook ""companion"" called ""Buy the RV: We Start Tomorrow"" on the Kindle store, a steal at £1.92!

  Wenn mich jemand nach einer ganz schrägen und außergewöhnlichen Serie fragen würde, dann würde ich ihm „Breaking Bad“ empfehlen.Ich meine, man muss ja erst mal auf die Idee kommen, einen krebskranken Drogenhändler zur Hauptfigur einer Serie zu machen … und den dann auch noch sympathisch wirken zu lassen.Das ist VINCE GILLIGAN gelungen, der eine unglaublich schwarzhumorige Serie um den biederen Chemielehrer „Walter White“ gemacht hat. Wie sich dieser Chemielehrer nach seiner Krebsdiagnose in einen rücksichtslosen Kriminellen verwandelt, ist schon richtig schräg.Das legt auch an Hautdarsteller BRYAN CRANSTON, dem man schon optisch den Biedermann voll abnimmt. Deswegen „schockiert“ einen dessen Verwandlung und seine Taten auch so, er ist jetzt nicht der klassische Drogenbaron, um es einmal salopp auszudrücken.So eine Serie funktioniert aber nur dann, wenn man dem Hauptprotagonisten ebenbürtige Darsteller zur Seite stellt. Mit AARON PAUL (Jesse Pinkman), ANNA GUNN (Skyler White) und DEAN NORRIS (Hank Schrader) sind da wirklich „gute Typen“ mit dabei.Also, von den Darstellern her passt das perfekt, aber auch die Story ist wirklich gut gemacht. Natürlich muss man Schwarzen Humor mögen, denn damit ist die Serie vollgepackt, das macht sie aus.In der ersten Staffel, die nur 7 Folgen hat, wird der Weg von „Walter White“, vom Chemielehrer zum „Drogenboss“ beschrieben. Wie gesagt, mit viel Schwarzem Humor, aber auch mit viel Brutalität und Skrupellosigkeit, was man dem guten „Walt“ eigentlich nicht zutrauen würde. Genau das macht die Serie dann auch aus, das ist einfach mal was Neues.Ich glaube, dass selbst die Macher der Serie vom Erfolg überrascht waren, denn mit nur 7 Folgen, scheint mir die erste Staffel nur sowas wie ein Testballon gewesen zu sein. Man wusste sicherlich selber nicht, wie sowas beim Zuschauer ankam, dass das dann so ein großer Erfolg werden würde, hatten sie vermutlich nicht erwartet.Mein Fazit: „Breaking Bad“ ist echt eine coole und extrem schräge Serie, wer auf ganz schwarzen Humor steht, der ist hier genau richtig. Moral und sonstiges Zeug sollte man über Bord werfen, sonst funktioniert die Serie nicht. Ich finde „Breaking Bad“ klasse, die Serie unterscheidet sich in vielen Belangen von üblichen Serien-Kost, ich wurde gut unterhalten und musste oftmals herzlich lachen!

  Diese Serie ist mit Abstand eine der besten Serien die ich je gesehen habe. D. h. auch Staffel 2 bis 6 fallen in Punkto Spannung und unvorhersehbaren Handlungen nicht ab. Das Ding ist rundum gut, nein sehr gut gemacht - absolut stimmig. Ich ertappte mich  dabei, dass ich eine gewisse Sympathie für den nicht nur Bösen gegenüber den wirklich Bösen entwickelt hatte. Hier wird die Entwicklung, das Abrutschen eines Kopfmenschen in Abgründe so dargestellt, dass man denkt ist das so, sind so Syndikate, Camorra etc entstanden.  Sie haben recht - wer soll das verstehen. Mein Rat schauen sie es sich einfach  an - sie (liebe Erwachsene)  werden es nicht bereuen.
",5
"
  ""Breaking Bad"", der Fernseh-Hit um den drogenkochenden Chemielehrer Walther White und seine Mutation zum Drogenboss Heisenberg (""I am the one who comes knocking""), wer hat sie nicht geliebt und jede neue Staffel Stück geschaut. Und danach alle nochmal geschaut.Jetzt, 2019, Bryan Cranston ist zum allgemein bekannten Star geworden, Aaron Paul ist ... verschwunden?, wollte ich mir den Spaß noch einmal gönnen und bin doch nicht allzu weit gekommen.Cranston und Paul sind immer noch einfach großartig, ebenso das Licht, die Musik, die ruhige Kamera, die seltsamen Kamerawinkel und die Fragen, die die Serie so ganz nebenbei aufwirft (""Wie geht man mit dem eigenen Tod/Scheitern/Erfolg um?"" ""Wie geht man mit seinem ersten Mord um?"" ...) all das begeistert immer noch. Ich habe immer noch gelacht, gestaunt und mir die selben Fragen selbst gestellt wie vor Jahren.Was ich bei den ersten Malen gemocht habe, zum beispiel den Sohn, toleriere ich inzwischen immer noch und habe kein großes Problem damit.Was ich damals nicht gemocht habe, das geht heute - für mich! - gar nicht mehr. Walthers Frau und deren kleptomanische Schwester haben mir den Spaß an ""Breaking Bad"" für dieses Mal genommen, wegen ihnen habe ich - bedauernd und erleichtert - aufgehört.Ich werde garantiert irgendwann wieder mit dieser Serie anfangen, dazu stecken einfach zu viele grandiose Erinnerungen und Geschichten darin, aber es wird noch eine Weile dauern.

  Breaking Bad ist für mich neben Dexter die beste Serie die es gibt. Ein in die Jahre gekommener Chemielehrer und Familienvater eines körperlich behinderten Sohnes, der nebenbei seinen Schülern in der Waschstraße die Autos wäscht spielt die Hauptrolle. Als Mr. White die totversprechende Krebsdiagnose bekommt führt eine Reihe von Verkettungen dazu, dass dieser 'Versager' gemeinsam mit einem seiner Schüler ins Drogengeschäft einsteigt. Das Zusammenspiel der beiden Hauptcharaktere unterhält im höchsten Maße. Der Film wurde mit viel Liebe zum Detail und gedreht. Auch die Nebendarsteller sind mit Bedacht ausgewählt und leisten einen entscheidenden Beitrag zu einem grandiosen Gesamtwerk.Da ich nicht zu viel vorweg nehmen möchten:Breaking Bad ist Pflicht!

  Sere TV ormai diventata un Must. Unica pecca è che chi ha ideato questa raccolta non si è accorto che la quinta stagione è divisa in 2 parti. Da come si presenta pare che le stagioni siano 6 in quanto la 5 prima parte è stata chiamata semplicemente ""Quinta stagione completa"" e la seconda parte ""ultima stagione"", il che non è vero per i motivi sopraindicati. Per il resto ottima qualità, dvd senza difetti e serie fantastica
",5
"
  Die Idee hat Charme, und aus ihr heraus funktioniert der immens spannende Plot selbst über die Vielzahl der Folgen: Ein äußerlich so unscheinbarer wie innerlich bescheidener Chemielehrer, dessen hohe naturwissenschaftliche Befähigung ihm bisher reinweg gar nichts nützte und der in seinem Bekanntenkreis der Vorstadt bestenfalls als linkischer Kauz, wenn nicht als liebenswerter Loser gilt, teilt, herausgefordert vom Schicksal, gehörig aus. Das alles lässt sich sogar als schwarze Ausstiegsphantasie aus der Tristesse des amerikanischen Mittelstandes von Suburbia anschauen: ""Ein Mann geht seinen Weg ... "" – freilich in sehr neuartiger Variante. Wenngleich unfreiwillig und von harten existenziellen Zwängen dazu getrieben. Das Bild des unvorteilhaften frisierten Helden im ausgebeuteltem Slip aus der Pilotfolge steht in eindrucksvoller Weise für diesen Mut der Verzweiflung.Etwas systematischer, aber ohne Spoiler: Walter 'Walt' Whites (Bryan Cranston) Dasein verlief nicht nur unspektakulär, sondern beinahe armselig, insofern sein dürres Gehalt als total überqualifizierter Chemielehrer ihn sogar zu einem diskriminierenden Zweitjob in einer Waschanlage zwang. Nachdem bei ihm Lungenkrebs diagnostiziert wird, bleibt er in sich zwar fest und souverän, zumal er wohl für sein Dasein überhaupt wenig hoffte, sieht aber seine Mittelstandsfamilie bedroht, insofern er seine Frau Skyler (Anna Gunn) und beider behinderten Sohn Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) versorgt wissen möchte. Also wird er aktiv, auf kriminell-kreative Weise im Sinne eines Doppellebens, zu dessen heilloser Dramatik es gehört, seiner geliebten Frau alles Wesentliche verschweigen zu wollen, was ihn in seinem stillen Heldentum in die Bredouille bringt.Von seinem lauten rabaukig auftretenden und sehr testosteronigen Schwager Hank (Dean Norris), einem bulligen und unverwüstlichen Polizisten im gelungenem Klischee des ordinären amerikanischen Männerbildes, erfährt Walter von den exorbitanten Gewinnen im illegalen Drogenhandel, insbesondere mit dem Methamphetamin 'Chrystal Meth'. Er lässt sich von Hank, der ihn für ein ausgemachtes Weichei hält, zu einer Razzia mitnehmen, erkennt dort in einem Flüchtenden seinen ehemals miserablen Schüler Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) wieder und sucht daraufhin zu dem Kontakt, um ihm vorzuschlagen, gemeinsam Meth zu kochen und zu verticken – mittels der Dealer-Verbindungen Jesses und seines eigenen chemischen Know-Hows. Das funktioniert in einem eigens besorgten Wohnmobil dank Walts Kompetenz im Chemischen rein technisch ganz ausgezeichnet, aber mit dem Verkauf des exzellenten Stoffes beginnen die Probleme in der Drogen-Szene.Spannend und brutal, wie sich Walter, der nicht zum Helden geboren ist, durchzukämpfen hat. Dramatisch erstklassig neben aller Action und allerlei chemischen Knalleffekten gerade die inneren Konflikte des Mannes ins Bild setzend, der zudem noch andauernd seinen Kompagnon Jesse, einem nervösen und latent dilettantischen Kleinkriminellen, beständig aus der Patsche zu helfen hat. Außerdem stresst die Gattin, der Unheimliches schwant, abgesehen davon, dass Walter, vom Krebs gezeichnet, als ein Moribundus agiert, den seine Verbrecherkarriere andererseits geradezu zu vitalisieren scheint.Erwartungsgemäß kommen die Einschläge immer dichter: Wollte Walter seine Krankheit zum Tode zunächst geheimhalten, muss er die Wahrheit darüber doch schließlich mitteilen, weil er ansonsten vor seiner Frau wegen eines mysteriösen Anrufs mit seiner Karriere als Drogenkoch aufgeflogen wäre. Zudem entdeckt der Polizist Hank eine Verbindung zum Schullabor Walters, wo dieser die Utensilien für sein Wohnmobil entwendet hatte ...Nachdem das ungleiche Paar Walter und Jesse zwar noch die unangenehmen Dealer Krazy-8 und Emilio mit immensen Kollateralschäden niederkämpfen konnte, handeln sie sich mit Tuco (Raymond Cruz) einen noch viel brutaleren, geradezu drogenpathologischen und daher völlig unberechenbaren 'Partner' ein, keine Ratte, sondern ein naturgewaltiges Raubtier, dem Walter jedoch, inzwischen martialisch kahlrasiert und im Mut des Todgeweihten, mittels einer Knallquecksilber-Attacke beinahe cool jenen Respekt abnötigt, der für die Geschäfte im Milieu so hilfreich ist.Zur Dramatik des Films paast die lebensfeindliche Halbwüstenlandschaft New Mexicos um Albuquerque. Häuslicher (Schein-)Frieden und Bedrohung liegen hier nah beieinander, ebenso wie mit den schwertskriminellen Drogen-Syndikalisten die bösen hispanischen Naturburschen einer ganz anderen Welt in die vermeintliche Zivilisation des gerade noch wohlständigen Amerikas eingedrungen sind.Sehr gutes Kino, absolut. Besonders dramatisch die ersten und beiden letzten Folgen, dazwischen etwas viel Familientheater, aber durchzuhalten und für den Hintergrund der weiterlaufenden Handlung von Belang. Was zeitweise an Dynamik eingebüßt wird, holt die zweite Staffel ohnehin wieder raus.

  I bought this dvd as the show had won many awards and I particularly enjoy the genre.  The story line is kind of a familiar one where the 'hero' is a very ordinary guy who makes a bad decision and then things start to go wrong very quickly and he's in over his head before he knows what's going on.  There are many surprises in the plot line nevertheless.  I found though that I was using the fast forward button through quite a few scenes which were mostly motivational explanations and tended to go over long.  There are also a couple of scenes where you just have to overlook the fact that something was glossed over and didn't quite make sense or didn't fit the timeline.  However for the price it's definitely worth a watch and I did buy season 2.  The acting and casting are both excellent.

  Ich schaue keine Serien. Ich finde Serien blöd. Alle. Außer Dexter vielleicht.....:-)Deshalb habe ich mich der Empfehlung, mal ""breaking bad"" zu schauen, konsequent verweigert. Bis Weihnachten. Da war mir wohl langweilig.Und dann? Dann haben wir den Film eingelegt und konnten nicht mehr aufhören zu schauen. Ich kann es kaum beschreiben. Die Story ist dicht, böse, voll schwarzem Humor, traurig, lustig und immer für eine überraschende Wendung gut.Klasse finde ich, dass dieser spießige, armselige, brave, angepasste Chemielehrer, der finanziell so gar nicht über die Runden kommt, sich so verändert. Wissen ist eben doch Macht.Und die Art und Weise, wie einem überraschende Wendungen um die Ohren gehauen werden, ist einfach großartig.Schauen!!! Es lohnt sich unbedingt!!

My friend would say, it is great. as soon as he finish this one I will get him the number 2 for sure. that is all I can really say. thank you

  Es ist kein Geheimnis mehr, Breaking Bad ist eine tolle Serie dank einer Hand voll interessanter Charaktere, um die sich alles immer wieder dreht sowie immer wieder auftretende brenzlige Situationen, aber woher kommt der immense Kult um diese Serie, die doch wie die meisten auch ihre Längen hat? Ich denke “BB“ ist ein wahrer Traum für alle Büroangestellte, Beamte, Schrebergärtner, Bausparer, Frührentner, ect, ect. Wir sehen zunächst ein passives, spießiges, vollständig domestiziertes Männlein, das sich abstrampelt, anstrengt nur um finanziell gerade so durchzukommen und daheim unterm Pantoffel zu stehen, von niemandem respektiert oder ernst genommen.Erst als sein letzter Rest Selbstbestimmtheit durch die Krebsdiagnose pulverisiert wird, verwandelt er sich, innerlich und sogar äußerlich, schrittweise in eine Mischung aus nomadenhaften, zwischen zwei Welten wandernden Wüstenbeduinen und skrupellosen Drogen-Warlord und erlebt plötzlich ständige Gefahren, verzwickte Situationen, muss moralische Entscheidungen treffen, Rückschläge verkraften, Initiative zeigen und so weiter. Seine Frau verstößt ihn zunächst, weil er nun seinerseits ihre bisherige Rolle in Frage stellt, kann sich seinem Einfluss aber bald nicht mehr entziehen (Stand jetzt, Ende der dritten Staffel). Ich wag mal die Prognose, dass er aus einer bürgerlichen Existenz bald vollständig und irreversibel herausgewachsen sein wird, wie Alice im Wunderland, als sie die falschen Pillen schluckt und mit dem Kopf durchs berstende Dach hinauswächst.

  Viel gehört von der Serie, kurz auf Arte reingeschaut. Habe mich überzeugen lassen und reise nun mit dem Lehrer auf seiner Mission mit. Eine der Topserien die zum Glück länger fortgeführt wurden. Wenn du nichts mehr zu verlieren hast, außer deinem Leben, dann gib alles und das letzte Hemd her.  So freute ich mich über zum Teil mehr als auswegslose Szenarien und erschrak über die obseszive Gewalt, die, nun ja hier not-wendig ist.Sympathische und zwiespältige Charaktere sind im Kommen. Homeland, Dexter, Lost u.a. Den aalglatte Typen wie dereinst  Magnum, Miami Vice oder Rockford wurden zum Glück in Rente geschickt.Der Held oder die Heldin braucht das gewisse etwas, die menschliche Macke und den dazugehörigen Makel um glaubwürdiger zu explodieren. Aus sich herauszukommen. Mitfiebern bei der begonnenen Therapie gegen das wie auch immer geartete Geschwür lohnt sich.

  Ich war mir anfangs nie sicher ob die Serie etwas für mich ist, da mich die Trailer eigentlich nie so richtig überzeugt haben. Als die Serie jetzt im Angebot war dachte ich mir für den Preis kann man nichts falsch machen und kaufte mir die erste Staffel.Die erste Folge ging schonmal extrem gut los, sie baute Spannung und eine wahnsinnig gute Story auf. Der Rest der Staffel ging so genial weiter, wurde sogar noch besser! Die Charaktere sind super. Die Serie ist genial gemacht und hat eine sehr gute Qualität. Das Bild ist einfach spitzenmäßig. Gleiches gilt für den Sound.Die Serie findet eigentlich genau die richtige Menge an Action, Unterhaltung, Spannung und eine mehr als gute Story.Alles in allem ist diese Serie der Hammer und ich werde mir defintiv auch noch die anderen Staffel zulegen.Ich kann diese Serie nur empfehlen, für jeden!Spitzenmäßig!!!

  Great suspense, a subtle dive into the border or what's right and wrong; besides it sheds light on why certain so-called ordinary people see it fit to redress tort , in this case the gross injustice of the US 2-tier medicine and the limited access to health care, I can't wait for the moment when the 2nd season becomes available,Olivier

  Nachdem man in letzter Zeit soviel über Breaking Bad gehört hat, hab ich auch damit angefangen, zumal ich selber Chemiker bin und von daher natürlich ein gewisses Interesse an einer Serie besteht, in der Chemie eine Rolle spielt. Ob die angedeuteten Synthesewege für Crystal Meth realistisch sind, vermag ich nicht zu beurteilen, ich komme aus einer anderen fachlichen Ecke. Aber das soll sicher nicht das Ziel der Serie sein, dem Zuschauer zu zeigen, wie man Drogen herstellt.Ich bin mittlerweile am Anfang von Staffel 3 und kann bestätigen, dass Staffel 1 etwas braucht, bis die Story Fahrt aufnimmt, danach wird's aber immer besser. Also schnell Staffel 1 durchziehen, damit das Setting klar ist, danach wird's spannend :-)

  Nachdem alle Welt über diese Serie sprach, bin ich dann doch mal aufgestiegen und habe einen Blick riskiert und diesen sollte ich nicht bereuen. Die Geschichte, des gewöhnlichen Chemielehrers, der nach Krebsdiagnose krampfhaft auf der Suche ist seiner Nachwelt und vor allem seiner Familie etwas zu hinterlassen, interessiert, ist es doch ein Schicksal das jeden treffen könnte und wie jeder von uns, ist er ein gewöhnlicher Kerl, mit weißer Weste, der sich seinen Weg bahnt.Es ist interessant mit anzusehen, wie er sich seinen Weg in die ""Unterwelt"" bahnt und mit den alltäglichen Problemen des Drogenhandels konfrontiert wird. Auch das Zusammenspiel zwischen dem konservativen Lehrer und dem unorthodoxen Schulabbrecher / Drogendealer / Junkie unterhält.Eine Serie, die gekonnt unterhält

  auf die schiefe Bahn geraten.....  so kann man Breaking Bad recht passend übersetzen.Und genau darum geht es auch in dieser mitreissenden TV Show.!!! Achtung kleiner SPOILER !!!Walt ist ein hochgebildeter, intelligenter, einfühlsamer ""Jedermann"" , ein vorbildlicher Familienvater und treusorgender Ehemann der sich letztlich zum Verbrecher wandelt weil er, seinen baldigen Tod vor Augen, seine Familie finanziell gesichert sehen will.Soweit so schlecht.Eigentlich macht Walt auch zunächst keine großen Fehler und gerät dennoch von einem Schlamassel in den Nächsten. Er unterschätzt schlicht die Eigendynamik seiner kriminellen Handlungen und ist fortan nur noch ein Getriebener. Schließlich will er nicht erwischt werden, bevor er sein Ziel erreicht hat, und vor allen Dingen will er nicht dass seine Familie von seinen Aktivitäten erfährt. Daher wird seine Lage immer prekärer, dennoch verfällt er nie wirklich in Panik, gerät aber immer wieder in Situationen wo er sich gezwungen sieht alles auf eine Karte zu setzen.IMO zieht die Serie genau hieraus ihre Spannung - Actionszenen sind ja eher spärlich gesät - und kommt es mal zu körperlichen Auseinandersetzungen, ist der biedere Walt dann logischer Weise auch meist nur der Looser, der die Hucke voll bekommt.Die Qualität von Breaking Bad sehe ich zum großen Teil genau in der Art und Weise wie diese Wandlung vom Normalbürger zum Kriminellen schleichend von statten geht, und der Protagonist bleibt dennoch der sympathische ""Held"" der Show.Eigentlich recht erschreckend, wenn man's genau bedenkt....und funktioniert auch IMO nur weil Walt niemals auch nur den leisesten Versuch unternimmt jemand Anderem die Schuld für seine Aktionen zu geben.Ich habe mir mitlwerweile alle Staffeln zu Gemüte geführt - ist halbwegs schwer dann nur die erste Staffel zu rezensieren ohne zu spoilern oder ohne Wissen der Folgestaffeln hier schon einfliessen zu lassen - zum Inhalt ist hier aber auch schon genug geschrieben worden -  Die Bildqualität ist sehr gut (DVD Versionen) Die Extras sprengen nicht den Rahmen des Üblichen (Audiokommentare, entfallene Szenen) und selbst die deutsche Synchro ist ganz passabel.  Aber ich empfehle dennoch jedem der es sich zutraut, sich die englische Originalfassung zu gönnen - die ist dann noch einmal ein ganzes Stück besser als die deutsche Version.

  Ich bin leider sehr spät auf den Breaking Bad Zug aufgesprungen. Nachdem mir die Serie von Mehreren Arbeitskollegen ans Herz gelegt wurde, habe ich nun zur DVD gegriffen und wurde bisher nicht enttäuscht.Super Serien Auftakt! Ein grandios spielender Bryan Cranston, der zu recht für seine Rolle als Walter White / Heisenberg gefeiert wird. Hätte ich ihm anfangs nicht so ganz zugetraut eine so ernste Rolle zu spielen. Aber ich wurde echt überrascht.Die Serie an sich beginnt schon sehr bizarr (ich sag nur Badewanne und Säure) und ich bin schon sehr gespannt wie es in den folgenden Staffeln weitergeht. Ich habe mir direkt nach der letzten Folge der ersten Staffel, die Staffeln zwei und drei bestellt.Mittlerweile kann ich den Hype um die Serie schon verstehen.

  This is a weird story about a seemingly every day kind man. He has a nice family with attractive bright wife, a slighlty handicapped son and a baby on the way.He is a teacher with chip on his shoulder who gets terminal cancer and feels a great need to get together enough money to keep his family after he is dead. Being a chemistry teacher he finds that he can make extremely pure coccaine ------ and thus begins the road down! Lots of great characters and lovely acting.Sounds weird but I'd definitely worth watching. Watch a few episodes and you'll be hooked right in there!

  Aufgrund des großen Hype um Breaking Bad habe ich mir die Serie angeschafft.Und ich kann es nicht bereuen.Die Serie ist auf einem sehr hohen Niveau produziert und gestaltet worden.Sie ist sehr mitreisen und auch immer wieder witzig und bis zum Ende zieht sich die Spannung.Ich habe die ganze Zeit mit spekuliert, was passiert als nächstes, wie kommt er aus dieser Situation wieder aus usw und plötzlich passieren Dinge mit denen man nicht rechnet.Die Schauspieler haben ebenfalls einen sehr guten Job gemacht und die Charaktere sehr gut rübergebracht.Die Serie ist nur weiter zu empfehlen.Ein Nachteil gibt es jedoch und zwar die Hülle der einzelnen Staffeln. Bis Staffel 3 hat man die selbe Verpackung und dann ist 4-6 anders. Das finde ich sehr schade, da somit kein einheitliches Bild im Regal entsteht.

  Hallo zusammen,bin erst vor kurzem auf diese Serie gestoßen und muss sagen, wer eine facettenreiche Serie mit ein wenig Tiefgang sucht, kann sich bei der hier angeboteten Serie ""Breaking Bad"" nicht vergreifen.Ich besitze derzeitig schon die zweite Staffel und ja es wiederholen sich einzelne Verhaltensmuster aber ist das nicht in jeder Serie so?Irgendwie wünscht man sich das doch auch um sich mit den einzelnen Charakteren identifizieren zu können.Die erste Staffel (Season 1) beinhaltet drei DVD's wobei auf der ersten und zweiten DVD 3 einzelne Episoden enthalten sind. Jedoch auf der dritten DVD nur eine einzige davon zu sehen ist.Zu den Spezials kann ich noch nichts sagen.Außer den drei DVD's enthält die etwas dickere Box nichts.Qualität:---------Die Video und Soundqualität ist gewohnter Standard.Hätte ich einen besseren Fernseher (aktuell 6 Jahre alt) und eine Sourroundanlagekönnte man diese Serie bestimmt gleich doppelt genießen.Ich bin auf jeden Fall zufrieden.Zum Inhalt:-----------Es geht hauptsächlich um einen recht hochbegabten Chemielehrer einer High School in den Vereinigten Staaten.Dieser muss nicht nur seinen Lehrerberuf wahrnehmen um seine Familie Überwasser zu halten, nein auch in einer Auto-Waschanlage muss ""Mr. White"" zusätzlich aushelfen um die nötigen finanziellen Mittel aufzutreiben.---Seine Frau ist schwanger, sein Sohn stark körperlich eingeschränkt.Nun erfährt Mr.White auch noch von einem Lungentumor im Endstadium.Durch Zufall gerät er nun auf die schiefe Bahn und merkt, dass man hier recht schnell Geld machen kann...aber auch zu einem hohen Preis....---Die ganze Serie ist sehr Facettenreich aufgebaut. Ob es nun um das familiäre Verhältnis von Mr. White geht, dass Thema Drogen(Abhängigkeit), dass Verhältnis zu früheren ""Freunden"", sein Verhältnis zu seiner Krankheit,  oder aber die Veränderung die Mr. White durch die einzelnen Umstände durchlebt und wie er damit auf andere Menschen Einfluss nimmt.Man muss sich auf diese Serie und die dort enthaltenen Charaktere einlassen. Wenn man das schafft hat diese Serie ein klasse Unterhaltungspotential. Drama, Tragödie, Humor, Freundschaft, Liebe,... alles enthalten.Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dieser Serie und kann sie jedem empfehlen.GrußH.S

  You've probably seen the Sopranos and gone through the Wire, like me you may also be addicted to Mad Men and to this list you really ought to add Breaking Bad. Written mainly by the X Files Vince Gilligan, Breaking Bad is comparable to all the series I've just referred to. Airing in the states on AMC alongside Mad Men this is sharply written, adult drama of the highest calibre. Recommended (and don't let the 'as seen on Five' tag put you off). This isn't another dull CSI knockoff!

  This is a review of the box set and NOT the tv series, all you need to know is that it's a brilliant piece of US tv and well worth buying with Brian Cranston taking a very major departure from the show that really made him a household name, Malcolm in the Middle.The set comes on 3 discs, it's got 5.1 Dolby Digital sound in 1.78:1 aspect ratio (full screen)is region 2 encoded and has a choice of english or german language versions only. There is a decent selection of extras but nothing that stands out so you get commentaries on 2 episodes along with a making of featurette, screen tests, deleted scenes, photo gallery, inside breaking bad featurette and a selection of interviews.If you are thinking about purchasing this disc or have yet to see the series then order it now, you won't regret it!

  Immer wenn man denkt schon alles gesehen zu haben, kommt man wieder auf eine neue Serie. Auch wenn ich die DVD-Box schon oft wieder ins Regal zurückgestellt habe, früher oder später wird man doch wieder schlauer.Nach den vielen guten Rezessionen hier und einem Wochenendtiefpreis bei Amazon nun also doch die erste Staffel gekauft. Tja,.... wie cool ist das denn. Ich fand das richtig gut gemacht und teilweise mit schauspielerischen Glanzleistungen gespickt. Daumen hoch.Keine 5 Sterne aber deshalb, weil mir die innerfamiliären Dialoge zu viel oder zu lang sind. Da nimmt die Serie gerade richtig fahrt auf und es folgt ein Szenenwechsel in dem wieder was besprochen wird oder irgendein Rückblick. Das ist einfach nicht so mein Ding. Die Grundstory passt aber. Somit locker 4 Sterne für eine Serie die gut unterhält, einen gewissen Witz hat und sich durchaus aus dem breiten Serienspektrum abhebt. Wer also etwas abgedrehtes sehen will, dem sei Breaking Bad wirklich empfeohlen.3 DVDs für eine Staffel finde ich auch immer etwas grenzwertig. Aber so ein 3-Set bei Staffel eins ist wohl eher ein Versuchsballon, wie die Serie ankommt und ob noch weitere Staffeln vom Sender bestellt werden. Somit führt das bei dieser ersten Staffel mal nicht zum Sternabzug.

  Like most people I know that are aware of this show, they found it and OD'd on it, watching basically the entire series in a short period of time. It's a great show, the writing is solid, the acting is amazing and the premise is the most original thing to happen to TV in a long time.The good:-Every episode with a few little things that weren't aired in the original episodes (overall, most episodes are pretty close to what aired, very few bad words, only one nude scene that I can recall)-Cast commentary provides insight into the characters and production of the show.-Lots of other extras including screen tests for the actors, a photo gallery, cast interviews and behind the scenes features.The Bad:-Maybe I am a cheap individual, but I still feel like the price is a bit much for basically 7 episodes (it premiered during the year of the writers strike). I know there are extras and the show is really great, but come on. I honestly think this should be priced at or just under $20.-No outtakes. I wish every show released on DVD had outtakes. I find them endlessly entertaining. Minor point and really my own preference, but I figured I would throw that in for those that are like me.It's a pretty good set.

  Als versierter Amerika-Reisender muss ich sagen, diese Serie enthält klasse Bilder vom Amerikanischen Südwesten, speziell von New Mexico. Absolut fantastische Aufnahmen, gepaart mit herausragenden schauspielerischen Leistungen von Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Bob Odenkirk und Dean Norris.Von der Spannung im Inhalt ganz zu schweigen. Die Produzenten, Autoren und Schauspieler haben hier wirklich großes geleistet, und ich kann diese Serie wirklich jedem im Alter zwischen 16 und 65 vorbehaltlos empfehlen, solange es sich nicht um einen völlig spießigen Moral-Apostel handelt!Mit chemischen Grüßen, euer Gebdieter

  So eine tolle Serie, ich sprühe über vor Begeisterung! ;)Nachdem ich per Zufall auf Breaking Bad stieß, und mehrere Bekannte schon Lobeshymnen dazu anstimmten,ließ ich mich zum Kauf hinreißen. Das war kein Fehler, denn Breaking Bad liefert Spannung, Dramatik, Witz und Tragik.Genau das, was ich mag! Anfangs fand ich die Charaktere total unsympathisch, das hat sich aber von Folge zu Folge geändertund mittlerweile besitze ich alle 4 bisher (in Deutschland) erschienen Staffeln und warte schon auf die 5.Richtig toll finde ich, wie man erleben kann, wie sich Menschen durch bestimmte Dinge verändern.Erst ist Walter ein kleinkarierter, öder Spießer, der von allen Leuten als ""Flasche"" angesehen wird, die sich nichtzur Wehr setzen kann. Sein zukünftiger Partner Jesse hingegen ist ein total verantwortungsloser Kerl, der von seinerFamilie verstoßen wurde und so gar nichts auf die Reihe bekommt. Beide Personen wandeln sich im Lauf der Geschichte soheftig, dass man es als Zuschauer kaum glauben möchte. Zu dem rasanten Wandeln von Charakterzügen bei den Hauptpersonen findeich die Grundidee der Serie und deren Umsetzung klasse. Breaking Bad hat so viele mitreißende und spannende Szenen, dass eseinen regelrecht fesselt. Man will nach einer Folge, die man gesehen hat, sofort wissen, wie es weitergeht.Ich denke, dass Breaking Bad jeden begeistern dürfte, der Thriller und Actionfilme mag. Dabei aber viel Gefühl und Humor dabei, top!

  Aunque tiene algún momento flojillo (no dejan de ser siete capítulos de 45 minutos), por lo general me ha tenido enganchado y al final con  ganas de más capítulos... Para mí es recomendable (aunque para gustos hay colores...), y dado como está el patio con ""bodrios"" como la francesa BRAQUO (por poner un ejemplo... todos cometemos errores), Breaking Bad cumple con creces en mi opinión, su finalidad de entretener. Si además les gustaba la química en el cole... alucinarán.

  Es sind drei DVDs in der Kunststoffverpackung bei der es sich um eine sog. Keep Case/Amaray-Hülle handelt. Die Hülle ist solide und ist gut verarbeitet. Die inneliegenden DVDs sind exakt rund und einseitig bedruckt. Es handelt sich dabei um zwei aus Polycarbonat gestellte Scheiben, die auf der einen Seite beschrieben wurden. Diese Seite funkelt sehr schön und schaut sehr futuristisch aus. Der darauf enthaltene Inhalt in Bild und Ton ist bester Qualität und lässt keine Mangel in visueller und akkustischer Darstellung erkennen. Hier kann ich allerdings nur den englischen Originalton bewerten, dan ich die deutsche Tonspur nicht kenne. Der Originalton ist Knack- und Rauschfrei, abgesehen von Szenebedingten Geräuschkulissen.Die durch die DVD transportierten und dargestellten Informationen können von mir nicht objektiv bewertet werden, da hier Interessen und Genre-Begeisterung genauso wie das persönliche Paradigma mit einfließen würden.

  Dazzling in its turns of darkness, humour and pathos this is a beautifully crafted adult drama. The acting is consistently superb, humane and without sugar-coating. Some of the comedy set-ups have a passing resemblance to Laurel and Hardy and that is mainly down to the brilliantly astute script.The writing of Vince Gilligan, who comes across as an unassuming geek in the interviews in the special features, seems to be living out some of his wildest fantasies and I can't help feeling he is in many ways like the protagonist himself. Good for him and lucky for us. All the Emmy awards and commercial success are very well deserved.

  Ich liebe die Serie, deswegen brauche ich hier denke ich nicht darauf eingehen, denn sie hätte die 5 Sterne wahrlich verdient.Diese BluRay jedoch wirklich nicht!ich habe zu keinem Zeitpunkt das Gefühl hier eine 1080p Bildqualität zu bekommen, nichtmal 720p, wenn ich ehrlich bin. Das Bild ist kräuselig und man hat teils eher das Gefühl hier eine VHS zu sehen.Ich weiß nicht was hier getrieben wurde, aber ich sehe hier absolut keinen Grund nicht die DVD dieser Staffel zu kaufen. Bei mir bleibt es jedoch bei diesem einen Kauf und das war leider die BluRay.

  Einfach die Serie schlecht hin. Man muss Bryan Cranston einfach mögen. Man kannte ihn jahrelang aus ""Malcom mittendrin"" als tollpatschigen Vater und nun in der Rolle seines Lebens als Walter White. Der Aufstieg zum gefürchteten Gangster ist einfach faszinierend und traurig zu gleich. Alles für die Familie war der Grundgedanke den er doch manchmal etwas vergisst und nach Gier handelt.Ich könnte die Serie immer wieder schauen und finde alle Schauspieler haben einen tollen Job gemacht.Riesen Empfehlung von mir und ein deutliches gefällt mir!

  My son-in-law lent us this dvd. He said, 'I thought you might enjoy this, it's about a man dying of cancer who becomes a drug dealer to pay for his treatment!'Needless to say, we put off watching it for as long as we could...until in the end good manners forced us to at least take a look. Oh boy! This is amazing drama, beautifully acted and very funny with it. I have now handed back the borrowed dvd and bought our own copy.We also have bought and watched season 2 and 3. We also have season 4 on order. This series just keeps getting better and better.If you live in Europe and want to get hold of season 3 and/or 4, then order it through Amazon Germany. This is what I did. The dvd covers are in German, but everything else is in English.

  Pedí la primera temporada de Breaking bad a ZORENO a través de Amazon. En la descripción del producto y en todas las opiniones de Españoles en Español afirmaban que también venia en Castellano.

Además contacto con estos señores y me dicen que para la devolución yo debo molestarme y perder horas de trabajo e ir a enviárselo a una oficina de correos...y que cuando lo reciban, ya me lo devolverán.

  Zweifelsfrei eine geniale Serie. Es wurde hierzu schon ausführlich rezensiert.Ich schreibe hier jedoch trotzdem, da ich vor dem Dienst Amazon Prime Instant Video warnen will. Amazon hat die Serie aus unerfindlichen Gründen gekürzt. Es handelt sich nichtmal um Gewaltszenen oder ähnliches welche von der FSK beanstandet wurden, sondern um ganz banale Dinge, welche auch für die Entwicklung der Geschichte wichtig sind. Beispiel: In Staffel 1 - Folge 1 - ca. 8. Minute, wird der Hauptcharakter (Lehrer einer Schule) von seinen Schülern gemobbt. Diese Szene fehlt bei Amazon gänzlich.

"
  Wir sind eigentlich gar keine Serien - Täter, aber von dieser Serie kommen wir nicht mehr los: Die Geschichte um den verzweifelten, krebskranken Chemielehrer Walt, der in Geldnöten steckt und so das ""Kochen"" von Meth beginnt,  diese Geschichte nimmt sich viel Zeit, entwickelt die Charaktere sehr subtil und glaubwürdig und lockt mit immer neuen wilden, tollen Ideen. Ab 16 ist gerechtfertigt, es gibt schon manchmal sehr brutale Szenen, aber die kann selbst so ein Weichei wie ich (hingebungsvolle Mutter von 4 Kindern) tolerieren, denn die Geschichte spielt in einem harten Milieu, und da wäre alles andere unglaubwürdig. Die (mir bisher völlig) unbekannten Schauspieler sind überzeugend und toll, die Geschichte wird niemals langweilig - Gäbe es 10 Punkte, würde ich auch die vergeben!

Addirittura, migliora col passare delle stagioni.

  Für mich ist das die beste Serie, die ich je gesehen habe. Und zwar nicht weil es um Drogen geht, was an anderer Selle schon mal bis zur Unkenntlichkeit mystifiziert und idealisiert wird, sondern aufgrund der einzigartigen Entwicklung der Charaktere. Der Protagonist wird durch seine Krankheit, wie der Titel schon sagt, auf die böse Bahn gebracht, allerdings führte er vorher auch ein Leben wie so viele in den Schranken des Alltags und der Familie, was auf eine gewisse Weise nur darauf wartete auszubrechen. Unglaublich genial finde ich auch die Entwicklung seines Schwagers welcher vom kumpelhaften Polizisten zu einem schwierig behandelbaren Charakter mutiert, eine Entwicklung, die er selbst wohl am allerwenigsten vorausgeahnt hätte. Die Zustammenstellung der Charaktere und die Art der Kameraführung in dem stets heißen New Mexiko machen die Serie zu etwas ganz Besonderem.

  Ich war anfangs etwas skeptisch ob das eine gute Staffel ist...aber meine Zweifel haben sich in Luft aufgelöst denn das ist die genialste Serie überhaupt.Der Chemielehrer Walter erfährt das er Krebs hat und sterben wird. Er trifft einen alten Schüler wieder, der damals die Schule abgebrochen hat und heute mit Drogen dealt. Um seine Familie abzusichern fängt er gemeinsam mit Jesse an Meth zu kochen. Und dann nahm alles seinen Lauf...Sie eignet sich sowohl für männliche als auch weibliche Serienjunkies. :)

  This series was recommended to me and when I started to play it immediately thought that it was not going to be my kind of thing.  How wrong can you be... within five minutes I was really enjoying it and watched two episodes in one go.  The characters are all very believable and I found myself quickly caring very much about the main character Walt and his lovely wife and son who is a superb actor.  I'm about to purchase series two and can't wait to start watching.  It's a series that appears to go on and on which for me is great now that I've found something that really is very different and highly entertaining.  I can't rate it enough.  Five stars plus!!

  Ich glaube, diese Serie polarisiert sehr stark!Auf der einen Seite ist die Serie toternst und tieftraurig und auf der anderen Seite gibt es so manchen Brüller mit viel enorm schwarzem Humor.Eine Mischung, die mir sehr zusagt, aber wer auf Gags am Laufband, wie bei ""Big Bang Theory"" oder ähnlichem steht, wird hier keine Freude haben.Im übrigen sollte jeder Raucher anfangen diese Serie zu gucken! Bei jeder Folge fragt man sich ein bisschen mehr, warum man seinem Körper das antut und ob man in Zukunft wohl auch sowas durchmachen wird! :-)Viel Spaß mit dem Nikotin-Pflaster in DVD-Form

  Schon lange habe ich mir überlegt die Serie zu kaufen, nun habe ich es getan und nicht bereut. Das einzige, was ich wirklich traurig fand... es sind nur 7 Folgen auf den DVDs T___T Wie ich aber gelesen hab, lag dies daran, dass zu dem Zeitpunkt gerade der Autorenstreik war und viele Serien haben ja darunter gelitten.Die Serie ist wirklich spannend. Wie weit ist ein Mann zu gehen, der im Grunde nichts mehr zu verlieren hat? Genau hier wird es einem aufgezeigt. Ich freue mich schon, wenn ich endlich die nächste Staffel schauen kann :)

  Die Kultserien liefen immer, in den 80er und 90er Jahren (z.B. The A-Team, Walker,Texas Ranger) Die heutigen Serien sind meistens, mittelmäßig bis schlecht. (z.B. Alcatraz, wurde nach 13 Folgen abgesetzt) Aber Breaking Bad kann, es durchaus mit den 80er und 90er Serien Problemlos aufnehmen. In der Serie geht es um einen Chemielehrer, der Lungenkrebs hat und mit Drogen ,,Kochen"" seiner Familie Geld hinterlassen möchte......... Äußerst Fesselnd, traurig und auch Humorvoll, etwas Action ist auch dabei, Eine Serie für Genießer

  Hier sind fähige Drehbuchautoren am Werk, die einen Charakter glaubwürdig gestalten und entwickeln können,Menschen aus Fleisch und Blut, und genau deshalb macht man sich Sorgen um sie. Und das ist das A und Ofür spannende Unterhaltung. Ganz erstaunlich lebensnah ist auch die psychologische Darstellung einesMenschen der bald an Krebs sterben wird. Aber was die Serie von fast allen anderen abhebt: Man wirdlaufend überrascht und es ist im nachhinein glaubwürdig. Deshalb ist diese Serie unglaublich spannend.

  So beginnt die erste Folge dieser Staffel. Abstrus. Die Geschichte entwickelt sich aus der Normalität heraus und zeigt - mit genügend Zeit dank fortlaufendem Seriencharakter - die psychologisch vorstellbare, langsame Entwicklung eines spiessigen Chemielehrers, zum Drogenproduzenten hin. Dank hervorragender Besetzung wirkt dies nie aufgesetzt sondern nachvollziehbar. Ich empfehle die Folgen sowohl in englisch als auch deutsch zu sehen. Durch die Synchronisation gewinnen aber auch verlieren einige Charaktere in ihrer Wirkung. Der Südstaatenslang ist natürlich nicht allen geläufig. Man kann aber einiges im Internet finden. Sehr empfehlenswert für alle die nicht so viel Spass an Vorabendserien haben, sondern sogar einmal über das gesehene nachdenken wollen. Mir ging es jedenfalls so.

  Ich habe die DVD meinem Freund zum Geburtstag geschenkt, nachdem all seine Kumpels berichteten, wie fesselnd die Serie ist.Ich bin gar kein Fan von Waffen/Drogen/Action Filmen/Serien, aber...Nachdem ich mit ihm ein paar Folgen geschaut hatte, bin ich süchtig geworden. Bryan Cranston ist ohne Zweifel ein toller Schauspieler. Nach seiner sehr unernsten Rolle, hätte ich ihm allerdings die Rolle eines krebskranken, ""bösen"", kriminellen Meth-Hersteller nicht zugetraut. Ich bin vom Gegenteil überzeugt worden und bin begeistert wie realistisch und ergreifend die Handlung ist.

  Diese Serie kann ich nur empfehlen. Ich habe die DVD's an einem Tag komplett angesehen und bin fasziniert von den Charakteren und der Handlung. Der Plot ist nachvollziehbar und ruhig, ganz anders als in anderen US-Serien. Gerade durch die größtenteils ruhige Darstellung bleibt das Schicksal des Hauptdarstellers hart und wird nicht heruntergespielt. Die Konflikte zwischen den Personen werden angedeutet und zum Schluss bleibt der Wunsch, sich die zweite Season zu holen.

  Alberne Happy Ends und lächerlich unlogische Handlungen gehören der Vergangenheit an! Diese Serie möchte keineswegs die schönen Seiten des Lebens darstellen. Viel mehr möchte sie zeigen, dass sich nicht jede Geschichte zu einem fröhlichen Freudenfest verwandelt.Walter White, ein Durchschnittsmensch und Familienvater, wird aus Geldsorgen zunehmend zum Kriminellen, indem er Methamphetamin kocht, und ruiniert sein eigenes Leben und das seiner Familie. Je tiefer er in das Kartell rutscht, desto astronomischer wird sein Verdienst. Irgendwann gibt es nun mal kein zurück mehr...Nirgends passt der Spruch besser als hier: ""Der Weg zur Hölle ist mit guten Vorsätzen gepflastert!""

  bello bello bello! nient'altro da dire su questa serie americana oramai diventata cultil protagonista è davvero un fenomeno (ha vinto anche dei premi grazie alla serie..) e il risultato è una serie che ti incolla al tv!5 stelle meritatissime, anche per il costo (10 euro per 3 dvd...)

  Da viele Freunde davon erzählten, konnte ich irgendwann nicht länger standhalten und habe mit die DVD bestellt. Und ich bin begeistert! War schon nach der ersten Folge gefesselt und hätte am liebsten alles gleich hintereinander geschaut. Der teilweis vorhandene derbe Humor ist auch total meins :DAbsolut empfehlenswert!

  Sucht Faktor 100%Habe die 1.te Staffel gekauft und somit ging es los. Am Ende saßen wir zu Zweit gespannt und gefesselt vor dem Fernseher. Bis zur letzten Staffel.

  Ich habe mir zum Einstieg zunächst nur die erste Staffel bestellt, um nicht - trotz der vielen positiven Rezensionen - die Katze im Sack zu kaufen.Nach den ersten paar Folgen hat mich die Serie, nicht zuletzt durch den großartigen Bryan Cranston, absolut gefesselt und ich habe im Anschluss an die erste DVD die restlichen verfügbaren 3 Staffeln bestellt.Die Story ist von Anfang an extrem dicht und da es sich ausgewiesenermaßen ja um eine Drama-Serie handelt, packt einen die Stimmung und lässt nicht mehr los.Ich habe es nicht bereut, alle 4 Staffeln gekauft zu haben, da ich dadurch keine Versorgungslücke entstanden ist.Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass die Serie direkt in die Top 3 meiner Lieblingsserien aufgestiegen ist und ich das Erscheinen der 5. Staffel kaum erwarten kann!

"
  Ich hab mir die erste Staffel für Weihnachten 2012 gekauft ohne nur eine Serie davon gesehen zu haben.Eigentlich bin ich kein Seriengucker aber die zahllosen positiven Rezensionen haben mich zu einem kauf verleiten lassen.Was soll ich sagen, bereits der Pilotfilm lässt erahnen welch riesen Potential in dieser Serie steckt. Schauspieler, Idee,Erzählung, Spannung, Humor, Dramatik, die Musik, einfach alles passt in dieser Serie.Nunja, was soll ich sagen, schlussendlich hab ich mich geärgert weil ich vorsichtshalber nur eine Staffel gekauft habe - aber ich konnte es vorher ja nicht wissen!!!Ich gebe hier mal eine sicherlich etwas gewagte Empfehlung ab: Wenn ihr die Serie nur vom hörensagen kennt und ihr euch eine Staffel probehalber kaufen wollt. Kauft einfach gleich alle Staffeln! Ich persönlich kenne niemanden, der von dieser Serie nicht begeistert ist/war.

  Probabilmente questa è una delle serie cult americane più seguite degli ultimi decenni! Una trama molto originale, dove droga, personaggi strani con nulla tra di loro in comune vengono a contatto per degli scopi quasi assurdi! Da vedere, ricca di colpi di scena!

  Consegna in tempi rapidi, il cofanetto contiene 3 CD e un foglio riassuntivo con la trama di ogni singolo episodio, inoltre nei CD sono presenti anche dei contenuti speciali.La qualità dei video non è delle migliori, però durante la visione di questi non ve ne accorgerete nemmeno.

  I had heard things about the show but nothing other than ""It's good.  You will like it"".  I was not sure but at $15 I was willing to take a gamble.  Glad I did.

  Also mich hat die Serie von Anfang an in Ihren Bann gezogen.Leute die auf den großen ""Knall"" warten brauchen gar nicht erst Anfangen zu gucken.Nochmal für alle......Das ist eine Serie und KEIN Kinofilm..... alles baut sich mit der Zeit auf und wer keine Geduld hat, sollte lieber einen Bogen um die Serie machen.

  Zunächst scheint es seltsam, Bryan Cranston in einer eher ernsteren Rolle zu sehen. Er spielt den an Lungenkrebs erkrankten Chemielehrer Walter White, der so kurz vor seinem Ableben nur noch ein Ziel hat: Für die finanzielle Sicherheit seiner Familie zu sorgen.Durch eine Verkettung witziger und abgedrehter Zufälle, trifft er auf den Crystal-Meth-Koch Jesse Pinkman, einen seiner ehemaligen Schüler. Und wie es der Zufall will tun sich die beiden zusammen und verdienen von dort an ihr Geld mit dem Kochen von Meth.Wenn alles immer so einfach wäre.Natürlich geraten die beiden in diverse Probleme, die mit witzigen Darstellungen und genialen Wortgefechten unterstrichen werden. Hinzu kommen ein bisschen Chemie, eine Handvoll schräger Typen und zwei Leichen, die irgendwie entsorgt werden müssen.Breaking Bad ist eine etwas andere Serie, die ebendeshalb so genial ist. Der Verbund von Tragik und Witz wird hier in genau der richtigen Dosis verabreicht.Eine tolle erste Staffel! Einziger Kritikpunkt: Es sind nur sieben Folgen und somit ist die Staffel etwas kurz, was dem Ganzen aber keinen Abbruch tut.
",5
"
  Consiglio vivamente questa serie (anche se può sembrare strana come trama); raggiunge dei livelli di drammaticità e umorismo agro-dolce favolosi.Da fan del creatore (X Files!!!!)  mi aspettavo il capolavoro che è! I DVD del cofanetto sono ok...pochi contenuti speciali a mio avviso.

  Breaking Bad è una serie tv americana che ha ricevuto moltissimi premi. L'evoluzione psicologica del personaggio principale e dei comprimari è molto interessante, la storia non è banale ed è ricca di colpi di scena. Gli attori sono eccezionali, con Bryan Cranston vincitore di 3 Emmy Awards (il corrispettivo degli Oscar per le serie TV) come migliore attore. La confezione contiene la 1a stagione completa, interviste con gli attori e altri contenuti speciali molto divertenti. Consigliatissima

"
  Was soll man zu Breaking Bad sagen? - Es ist einfach DIE Serie.Die Geschichte ist nicht nur unglaublich spannend und fesselnd, sie ist auch sehr gut filmisch umgesetzt.Bryan Cranston und Aaron Paul übertreffen sich als unschlagbares Team einfach selbst. Die Entwicklung des Walter White von einem normalen Chemielehrer zu einem skrupellosen Drogenboss mit anzusehen ist unbezahlbar.Ich wünsche mir tatsächlich, ich könnte mein Gedächtnis löschen, nur um alles noch einmal von vorne gucken zu können!Diese Serie ist ein MUSS!

  La prima serie ha una forte impronta comica malgrado i contenuti espliciti decisamente non per bambini.Io penso che la massima soddisfazione la si abbai riguardandola subito dopo l'utilma puntata, per uan specie di effetto: da dove siamo partiti.Consiglio vivamente tutta la serie!

  Ein absoluter Hit, was das Ensemble von Breaking Bad da abliefert. Wer es skuril, etwas härter und dennoch mit Tiefgang mag, der ist bei dieser Hammerserie gut aufgehoben!

  Wahnsinn! Muß man sehen. Ein Muß für jeden Serienfreak!! Die Geschichte ist der Hammer, man will immer mehr sehen und fühlt mit den Protagonisten voll mit.

  Nachdem Staffel 1 schon verschlungen wurde, kaufte ich mir auch Staffel 2 und warte sehnlichst auf Staffel 3.Beide Darsteller glänzen in ihren schauspielerischen Darstellungen.

  Für manch einen wird das Dargestellte vielleicht zu phantasievoll ankommen.

  Excellent série. Scénario original, description en creux de la société américaine très intéressante. Comment le foutoir peut s'inviter dans une famille moyenne et s'amuser à secouer le vaisselier. L'argent est partout, surtout quand il est absent. Et tout part de là. La possibilité de se soigner, la possibilité de figurer dans telle garden-party, la fierté du fils handicapé pour son père maladroit, la sérénité pour un avenir duquel devrait rapidement disparaitre le même père, l'apparition providentielle des billets vert de l'économie de la défonce, la justification de l'injustifiable pour son obtention, ... Cette série s'amuse à enlever et ajouter des rouages dans la mécanique, famille, travail, salaire, santé et se délecte de voir comment tout cela part en tête-à-queue...Réjouissant...Côté marchand : on regrettera l'absence de description des caractéristiques audio du DVD. Il n'y a pas de sous-titre français dans cet import. Mais sans être très bon en anglais, on arrive à suivre l'essentiel avec les sous-titres américain.

  The basic scenario is pretty sound. Man with terminal illness and short of money needs to ensure the survival of his family.After a while I looked upon it as a very black comedy, and I'm not sure if that was the intention.A couple of little things nagged at me.A teacher working in a car wash!! Why didn't he just do some out of hours tutoring?I very much doubt if any High School, or even University would have huge containers of concentrated hydrofluoric acid in their normal stock.It's nerdish I know, but my old chemistry lecturers would be turning in their graves at the thought.I have only watched four episodes to date and must admit that it is all quite entertaining.I can see the logic of his situation. I remember sitting in a chemistry lecture many years ago that included the synthesis of amphetamine and thinking 'that's pretty easy then', but obviously never attempted to put it into practice.Not sure if I will be tempted to buy more episodes..

"
  L'inizio di una saga epica.E' una delle serie TV più belle mai create e la prima stagione introduce bene i personaggi e le storie.
",5
"
  obwohl man von einer Serie im klassischen Style gar nicht reden. So voll gepackt mit Action und Humor -mal etw. ganz anderes. Man denkt man schaut einen spannenden Film so spannend ist es. Nur zu empfehlen und mit nichts vergleichbar..
",5
"
  You know, it's not until the ""intervention scene"" in Episode 5 that this series truly comes alive.  The family dynamic (as well as the relationship between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman) sustains this show.  While the pilot and general premises are captivating, it's the characters that make the show.  Both seasons 1 and 2 are incredible; I just wish a single season was a little longer.  Nevertheless, the stories within the episodes are nicely contained, but the series to series drama is incredibly well-done.  I have nothing but good things to say about Breaking Bad.  I look forward to Season 3's release on DVD.

  Habe angefangen diese Serie zu schauen und konnte garnicht mehr abschalten.Macht süchtig.
",5
"
  I purchased this DVD collection having read a review which said it was equally as good as The Wire, which was excellent.Although a slowish start this series is very watchable and as the series evolves the characters are revealed and is a must watch.Would recommend this if you really enjoy good television, there are no dramatic explosions to liven the pace up, the script is good and flows and the characters, flaws and all, are very believable.  The actors all fit their roles and give an excellant performance.

  Aunque no contiene audio y subtítulos en castellano no me importa, por que tengo la edición completa y en este caso solo quería esta edición por el diseño del steelbook ya que aquí en España te cuesta más del doble.
",5
"
  Die erste Staffel ist packend und kann süchtig machen.Die Qualität der blue Ray ist teilweise grauslich. Sollte wohl hochauflösend sein, ist es aber teilweise nicht.Also kann man genauso auch die DVD kaufen.

"
  Die erste Staffel fand ich sehr gut, haute mich jedoch nicht um. Aber zumindest so, dass ich definitv wissen wollte, wie es weitergeht. Inzwischen bin ich bei Staffel 4 angekommen. ;-) Interessante Story, empfehlenswert.

"
  La serie Breaking Bad ci regala uno spettacolo assicurato! Ricca di colpi di scena, di dialoghi profondi e di azioni folli. La consiglio vivamente!
",5
"
  Una serie que ha sido clasificada como de las mejores series de televisión. Vale la pena tener la serie completa. Cada temporada se pone mejor.
",5
"
  Die Serie ist echt spannend, habe mir auch die anderen Seasons bestellt :-)Schauspieler sind TOP, Drehorten und Methoden oft ungewöhnlich, daher macht es die Serie noch spannenderDrehszenen erinnern eher an einen Film als an eine Serie.Pures Filmfeeling!
",5
"
  Diese Serie ist sehr interessant aufgebaut und hat Potential zum Klassiker. Gut gespielt mit viel schwarzem Humor. Kann ich nur jedem EMPFEHLEN.
",5
"
  Die Serie ist wirklich genial!Und Schauspieler finde ich auch sehr gut, vor allem Bryan Cranston bringt die Rolle sehr gut rüber.Zur Blu-Ray:Das Bild könnte meiner Meinung nach etwas besser sein, dafür dass die Serie so neu ist...Den Ton finde ich so weit in Ordnung.Fazit: Kaufen lohnt sich definitv für den Preis ;)

"
  Die erste Staffel von Breaking Bad ist sehr kurz (7 Folgen) dafür aber umso besser. Was man dort zu sehen bekommt und wie sich vor allem die Charaktere entwickeln ist der wahnsinn, genauso wie der Schluss.
",5
"
  No la había visto y la recomiendo a todo el mundo. Trágica y cómica en la proporción adecuada,simplemente fantástica. Excelente.
",5
"
  Ist halt die DVD von einer Fernsehserie. Ich möchte jetzt hier nicht den Inhalt diser Serie nacherzählen. Würde zu lange dauern.
",5
"
  Mit dieser Serie kann man absolut nichts falsch machen. Ich habe sie jemandem Geschenkt der sie zwar kannte aber aus beruflichen Gründen nie dazu gekommen ist sie anzuschauen. Die Freude war groß!
",5
"
  Kaufen!!!
",5
"
  Habe mir gleich alle 6 Staffeln gekauft und kann mich gar nicht satt sehen an Walter White und Jessy Pinkman! Die erste Staffel ist schon stark und es steigert sich von Staffel zu Staffel, nicht wie bei anderen Serien wo es ab der 2. Staffel bergab geht!
",5
"
  Breaking Bad ist einfach mit die beste Serie, die ich je gesehen habe.Mit jeder Folge wird die Serie interessanter und besser.Bryan Cranston ist unglaublich gut in dieser Rolle.
",5
"
  Tolle erste Staffel der Erfolgsserie. Der Mix zwischen Drama und Humor begeistert. Die zweite Staffel ist schon bestellt :-) Tip: Beser die Blueray Variante wählen. Bessere Bildqualität, besserer Sound und wesentlich mehr Extras für verhältnismäßig geringen Aufpreis.
",5
"
  Bellissima serie e bel cofanetto ad un prezzo giusto!! Ne avevo sentito molto parlare ed in effetti soddisfa le aspettative!!!
",5
"
  Die DVD an sich natürlich gut und die Serie an sich die beste die es gibt (neben TWD). Aber die Verpackung erinnert leider an VHS kasetten :( Sie ist sehr dick und schwarz und innen ist nichts außer den 3 DVD's. Das finde ich sehr schade da zb. bei der Dexter DVD alles von innen zusätzlich bedruckt und sehr schön gemacht ist.

  Great special features, great show.This arrived quickly without issue
",5
"
  die erste Staffel war ein  Geschenk für meinen Mann, jetzt ist er süchtig .. und nicht mehr ansprechbar ;-)spannende packende Geschichte.. man kann nicht aufhören und wartet auf die nächste Staffel.
",5
"
  Tolle Serie! Will nix verraten, aber echt zu empfehlen! ;-) Tolle Schauspieler, hammerharte Action, krasse Story, sehr unterhaltsam! Aber nix für Kinder!
",5
"
  confermo le recensioni precedenti...una vera sorpresa!!!! Non sembra di vedere una serie televisiva... ogni puntata è un film vero e proprio, dove gli attori sono dei veri protagonisti.Amazon è sempre il numero 1 per puntualità, spedizione.
",5
"
  veramente una gran sorpresa questa serie tv che non è stata molto pubblicizzata in italia ma negli USA è già nella storia.
",5
"
  Ottima stagione, non mi pronuncio su trama e interpretazione degli attori poichè lo sapete già tutti.. Ottima e consigliatissima! Spedizione sempre top
",5
"
  tout d'abbord j'aime bien Bryan Cranston pour l'avoir découvert dans Malcom in the middle, donc j'ai dû m'adapter à son nouveau personage, qu'il incarne de façon brillante. Assez du comme sujet, mais j'ai bien hâte d'écouter la suite!! à voir et découvir sans faute!
",4
"
  Lo adoravo già da quando con i miei figli ci scompisciavamo dalle risate con Malcom; dimenticate quella storia, l'attore  cambia veste, ma per la sua grandiosa interpretazione si è guadagnato un golden globe. Da vedere!
",5
"
  Pochi sono i film che trasmettono emozioni forti e contrastanti...ancora più raro è il caso delle derie tvCon questa serie hanno fatto centro...un vero capolavoro da vedere assolutamente..La consegna di amazon impeccabile come sempre
",5
"
  den lässt es nicht mehr los. Geniale Schachzüge, ständig wechselnde Folgen, nie ein Ende vorhersehbar, einfach toll!! Schauspieler klasse, Alle Seasons super!
",5
"
  This show needs to be picked up by the UK and be shown for all to see! The writing is unexpected the characters totally believable and Bryan Cranston is fabulous as Walter White. It sucks you in and makes you want more and more!Great great great - get hold of it - dont wait for it to come over here buy the DVD - you will not regret it and if you do then there's something wrong!!
",5
"
  Serie Tv spettacolare, senza dubbio tra i migliori drama di sempre. Breaking Bad è sinonimo di qualità e di perfezione sia nella sceneggiatura che nella recitazione. Mi sono un pò pentito di aver preso i dvd perchè la qualità video non è eccelsa.
",4
"
  Die erste staffel der Erfolgsserie, kenne sie schon seit 2009, da kannte die Serie noch niemand. Die erste Staffel ist vielleicht die langweiligste, aber nur im Vergleich zu den anderen staffeln
",5
"
  El precio era bastante inferior a la edición Española. También incluye el idioma Español. Ningún problema. Envío rápido. La serie es tan buena que ya he adquirido la segunda temporada.

  Excelente producto

  Quite funny at times. Twists and turns you don't know who to feel sorry for next. Will definitely get the next series

"
  Una delle serie tv più avvincenti che io abbia mai visto. Consigliati sisma a tutti anche a chi non è amante di questa categoria di home video. Bellissima davvero, ogni stagione è più sorprendente della successiva!
",5
"
  One of the best tv series of all time. It's right up there with The Wire, Lost, Homeland, etc, etc. Everyone will enjoy this.
",5
"
  Die ersten Minuten entfalten einen Sog, dem man sich nicht entziehen kann. Und auf diesem Niveau geht es dann weiter. Der an Krebs erkrankte Chemielehrer Walter White macht aus seinem Leben eine wahnsinnige Achterbahn. Respekt vor den Drehbuchautoren!
",5
"
  Go watch 'Malcolm in the Middle' then watch a few episodes of this. Bryan Cranston is so versatile it's insane. This series is the most exciting, original thing to appear on TV in years! Every second of it is brilliant, and it blends action, drama and even moments of comedy. Aaron Paul is perfect, in fact everyone is!

  Hatte meine erste Season irgendjemandem geliehen, und (natürlich) nicht zurückbekommen. Kult-Serie mit grandioser Story, perfekter Besetzung, Spannung, Humor, toll gezeichneten Charakteren.

  Das einzige was ich zu Breaking Bad sagen kann ist, dass diese Serie wohl die beste Serie ist, die ich bisher gesehen habe.Der kauf war einfach und die Blu-Ray kam schnell und unversehrt an.

  favoloso...che dire...bellissima...non me l'aspettavo così...me l'avevano descritta bene, ne avevo visto qualche episodio distrattamente...rivederla tutta è davvero forte... sono pienamente soddisfatto...ed Amazon è un pianeta fantastico

  Sehr spannende Folgen (je 60 Minuten) und ich habe jede Minute mitgefiebert. Ich verstehe jetzt, warum alle so heiß auf die Serie sind.

"
  una serie fantastica che sorprende di stagione in stagione, il dvd è pieno di chicche interessanti e la qualità video è molto buona.
",5
"
  Die Serie ist einfach genial. Der langsame Absturz von Walter White(Brian Cranston ist einfach der Hammer in der Rolle) ist tragisch, faszinierend und absolut mitreißend.
",5
"
  Zur Zeit so ziemlich das Beste auf dem Markt erhältliche was US-Serien hergeben. Keine mega aufdringliche Filmmusik. Exzellente Schauspieler. Geniales Script!

  Una serie tv incredibile l'unica pecca negativa e'che te la vedi tutta quanta di un colpo e devi correre per acquistare la seconda serie

  Breaking Bad ist einfach nur eine Geile Serie....ich komme nicht mehr zum schlafen da ich so davon gefesselt bin...Wer also auf solch eine Art Serie steht sollte zugreifen...

  Totalmente en español, y si te gusta la serie, una gran compra, muy barato y indispensable para un amante de breaking bad

  Eine der besten Serien die es gibt / gab.Ich persönlich kann Breaking Bad nur weiter empfehlen!Bei Filmen ist es jedoch immer Geschmackssache.

  C'è poco da dire, se non che le puntate non è che siano tante e uno ne vorrebbe molte di più. Da qui inizia una serie straordinaria, con interpreti straordinari. Consigliata, naturalmente.

"
  Drama, a bisserl fies, schwarzer Humor und immer gut für Überraschungen. Habe die Box aufgrund der Rezensionen gekauft und bin froh drum. BB kann ohne Zweifel mit The Wire, The Shield, Nip Tuck, Dollhouse, Deadwood, Cracker und Firefly mithalten. Übrigens, auf der UK-DVD ist die dt. Tonspur enthalten. (Language: English and German)

  Nulla da segnalare.Il DVD è quello che ho ordinato e mi è stato recapitato come previsto.Non aspettavo altro !

  I suggest to buy it if you never watch the serie for 15$ or less its a good price. The only thing it bother is there is no subtitle in english for the series besides that its all goof.

  Eine der besten Serien überhaupt! Suchtpotential sehr hoch! Mir wurde sie von einigen Freunden empfohlen und ich kann sie wirklich auch nur weiterempfehlen.

  Una serie da vedere assolutamente. una dopo l'atra dalla 1 alla 5 non riuscire a smettere di guardala.....invidio chi ancora deve vederlo!

  Die Serie ist so, wie ich mir es vorgestellt habe. Schauspielerisch eine Meisterleistung der Hauptdarsteller. Die Brutalität gehört zu dieser Geschichte. Die Wandlung des Hauptdarstellers ist sehr glaubhaft dargestellt.

  Bof bof, la première saison (surtout les premiers épisodes sont vraiment nuls mais il faut voir la première saison pour pouvoir comprendre les suivantes qui sont excellentes!!)Une fois pris dans la série on ne peut s'empêcher de regarder les épisodes suivants.

  There are only seven episodes in this first series of Breaking Bad but I was so hooked I watched them back to back - it has been a very long time since I have felt that enthralled by any series.The synopsis below does not give anything away beyond the first episode.The first episode opens with Walt (played by Bryan Cranston) walking away from a burning RV, gun in hand minus his trousers and with police sirens blaring in the distance.  The scene looks bizarre and surreal as Walt couldn't look anything less like a criminal if he tried.  The story then switches back to the present day and begins to fill in the gaps as to how he came to be in that position.  This is a technique used frequently in both series one and two.Walt, a middle class, law abiding chemistry teacher discovers that at the age of 50 he has terminal lung cancer.  He is working two jobs to keep the family finances afloat.  His oldest son, Walt Junior has cerebral palsy and his wife, Skylar finds herself unexpectedly pregnant at the age of 40.  Walt is at a loss as to how he is going to provide financial security for his family after his demise and in the short term how he is going to fund his medical care.  He needs to get his hands on a vast sum of money - and he needs it quickly.Walt seeks out one of his former students, Jesse (Dean Norris) - a time wasting, good-for-nothing layabout and small time drug dealer.  Much as it pains Walt to have anything to do with Jesse, he needs him for the one skill set he does have - cooking and selling methamphetamine.  Together, the pair come up with a scheme to make the best meth on the market and to get rich very quickly.  Suffice to say, things don't always go smoothly for them in their new business venture.The series is full of black humour - some of the things that happen are so awful that they are absolutely hilarious.  The subject matter won't suit everyone's taste, some might even find it offensive, but I have to admit that I laughed until I cried on many occasions.Bryan Cranston plays Walt perfectly.  He is completely believable in his role and it is impossible not to side with him and want him to be successful even though at the back of your mind you have that nagging reminder that he is now producing Class A drugs.The series doesn't make use of cliff-hangers or other tension inducing stunts commonly used in series such as 24, Prison Break, Oz etc - it simply doesn't need to bother with that type of ploy.  Instead it relies on an imaginative plot, well written script and well rounded characters.  When one episode ends all you will want to do is watch the next one; I would be surprised if anyone could stretch this series out over a long time period.The only negative is that there were just seven episodes - I wanted more as will anyone else who watches this series.  Suffice to say I immediately bought series two and am currently watching those pretty much back-to-back.Overall, a brilliant drama series.  If you missed it first time around on TV then grab a copy now, you won't regret it.

  Breaking Bad ist spannend, atemberaubend, witzig und abschreckend. Man durchlebt ein Wechselbad der Gefühle, vor allem kann man nicht mehr aufhören, weiter zu gucken. Aber Achtung: Es ist sehr zeitraubend, alle Folgen zu sehen.

  I've genuinely never written a review for anything ever at all in my life,but this show has compelled me to.I've seen most of the US dramas,The Wire,Sopranos,24 the list is endless of great TV drama coming out of the US in recent years,this one though...Is in my opinion the best yet,I came to it on a very johnny come lately vibe but I'm so glad I did.I've now watched all 4 Seasons and it just got better and better,such great storylines,characters,twists.Honestly please do yourself a favour and buy the first season its so cheaply priced on Amazon,it really is worth every single penny.As usual this great TV show was overlooked in the Uk.Go on get addicted to the show,but stay off the Meth kids.David CooperLondon

  Tout a été dit dans les nombreux commentaires élogieux !Une série d'une qualité exceptionnelle qui va bien au delà de l'effet d'engrenage que l'on retrouve ici.Il y a de la profondeur en plus, c'est ""fouillé"", parfois émouvant parfois hilarant...Et la morale me direz-vous ? là est la question.

  As an English person, it's normal to be presented with high quality American Television. Whether it be the action of 24, or the profanity-laced drama of Sopranoes, as a Brit you realise most of the top-end TV is being made across the Atlantic. Breaking Bad is no exception. I was pretty much hooked from episode one, and it did it all without high-octane action, mindless violence, expletives or gratuitous sex - and that's not to say Breaking Bad doesn't have those things, it just has them as part of a gripping, extremely well plotted story. That's the thing here, the balance of the story is truly superb. The development stages of the characters brilliant. The character dynamics excellent. Breaking Bad is a rarity, in that it goes back to good storytelling and characters before anything else. Tense, funny, shocking, moving - it's an absolute gem (or crystal, if you excuse the pun, you'll find out!). The premise is intriguing, and rewarding, with great acting throughout, and it has completely got me! Almost as addictive as meth being produced in that RV!

  I was looking forward to watching this series after all the recent hype and awards it has won but although I did watch it I was not tempted to buy the second series.

  And here come some more. Oh my God! This is, no contest, the most drop-dead, gasp for breath, shout at the screen, run-around-the-block-at-the end-of-every-episode in sheer exultation series I've ever seen on TV. It's a unique, sustained, tragi-comic masterpiece of the very highest quality - in any medium. To put it in context, I adored the Sopranos from start to finish; my wife and I have watched the whole set several times, having accumulated all the disks from around season 4, when we first got hooked. Other programmes we've loved as a couple have been Huff: a delightful surprise and, in its time, another product of taking a chance with the Amazon reviewers of seemingly similar taste and being blown away by the quality of the work.If it helps you into our mind-set, the same thing goes for Rome, in its way; and ditto for mutual matrimonial appreciation of Boardwalk Empire. Jimmy McGovern's The Street, Mad Men and the Andy Whitfield Spartacus also make it onto our conjugal video juke-box - although on slightly differing criteria, respectively.So that's a couple of factors to frame my absolute respect for Breaking Bad and its creators: the fact that my wife loves it, too - and I trust you can see from the above that we're selective with our devotions - plus the rare justification of a same-breath mention with, above all, the Sopranos. Indeed, if the creators of Huff and the Sopranos teamed up with the Cohen Brothers... you might just about get into the quality zone established by Breaking Bad.My gratitude goes to the combined deities of taste, luck and internet browsing for dropping me onto the Breaking Bad page a couple of months ago. It could have been one of the better ""if you liked this"" links; then the synopsis and reviews - at that point, intriguing and suggestive, rather than fully bought into.Well, thanks Heavens for chance, informed guesswork and 1-Click! Because season 1 of Breaking Bad arrived soon thereafter. Still not entirely convinced that Sarah would go for it (actually at the ""possibly"" rather than ""probably"" point right then) I left it a couple of weeks before we ventured on the first episode......and that was it - hooked from the start! Amazing! Family narrative, left field content, a plot that never stops thickening, oblique ideas centre stage, difficult moments and material, hilarious comedy, quite astonishing action set pieces, suspense. And some of the longest conversations, effortlessly engaging, moving, touching, side-splitting and the rest, that TV has been brave enough to entertain for a long time. For me, it's the ultimate compliment; that is, a flawless, no compromise, sustained reciprocal compliment to the audience's intelligence. Combined with sheer entertainment value - and here we are getting into Shakespearian territory - Breaking Bad cannot be judged any less than, as I said, superlatively superlative! Oh, by the way, that's me doing the shouting, because I'm so excited. Please don't let me mislead you: my glee and enthusiasm is stirred by the quiet subtlety and sheer good taste that more accurately characterises Breaking Bad than my ravings do. My excuse for the hurrahs and eurekas is the comparative rarity of this level of artistic brilliance, well, anywhere nowadays.It really is quite magnificent. Literally never a dull moment. With Breaking Bad, it's actually almost an ""of course"" paragraph to mention the cast (every single character selling every single line and moment to maximum, utterly authentic value); the overwhelming cinematic production values, photography, soundscape (glorious for home cinema), music - even the dressing of the actors - sublime editing. But it must be done; as the team assembled here, with the world-class writing they have to work with, pulls off some of the greatest televisual strokes ever accomplished.I ordered season 2 after 3 episodes. These quickly followed by 3 and 4 from Amazon Germany (thanks again to Amazon contributors - yes, they come packaged for the German market but with pure English disks in the box). With just 2 episodes left, we've gone through all 4 series from start to end in one unbroken sequence. And, guess what; yes, we'll be starting all over again as soon as we've finished. It starts great and just keeps getting, miraculously, better. Superb.This should be the most celebrated TV programme of all, by any fair standards. So, whatever: do yourself an unregrettable favour and join the comparatively rare but incomparably satisfied fan-base of this exquisite programme. Now, please.

  Once I started watching this series, I didn't stop, until I got to the end... It is a perfect parablefor what happens when good people, turn bad, and money and power become a prioritised motivation,over love and happiness... Every series, is fantastic, and brilliantly acted, and a real well made programme.Recommended as it is superior to so much stuff you'll see... (Or won't see).

  Mentioned in the same breath with The Wire and The Sopranos it was one good thing to emerge from the sad loss of James Gandolfini. Really clever, thoughtful and with a subtle humour every episode was a guilty pleasure of anticipation.

  I was on the fence about watching this show, particularly when everyone I knew who had ever seen it had said it was excellent...something about the concept (and the overwhelming praise) seemed offputting.When I finally got around to watching the first episode, I was staggered by the pace, writing, acting and style. From the first shot of the trousers falling through the air to the breakneck escape from the wailing sirens, I was hooked. Within 2 days I'd demolished series 1. Here I am three weeks later, completely up to date.THAT is a sign of a great TV show.Cranston and Aaron make a great oddball partnership. The writing shines and the dialogue sparkles. Not a minute is wasted on extraneous exposition or pointless character development.This is not a series with peaks and troughs. Series 1 is great all the way through, and only seven episodes. It's a gateway drug into a wider world.

  Heard a lot of good things about this show. Having never heard of it before a recommendation, I decided to take the plunge and just buy it as I love a good box set!I was not disappointed in the slightest! Being only 8 episodes long, I watched the whole box in one day.Great story! Moving and funny at the same time. Relatively unknown cast but all makes for one of the best TV box sets I've ever watched! Defiantly but this if you are considering!!

  Exceptionally gifted chemist Walter White is in a dead end job teaching disinterested high school pupils, big mortgage, loans, teenage son with CP, pregnant wife, second job washing cars to make ends meet and finds out he has cancer with roughly 6 months to live. How can he make enough money in 6 months to leave his family financially secure?The answer comes to him when he goes for a ride along with his DEA brother in law on a crystal meth bust and sees an ex pupil of his escape from a bedroom window. And so begins one of the most engaging mismatch partnerships on TV.However his exceptional quality product soon attracts all sorts of attention and they find themselves facing an escalating series of moral and logistical challenges as they get dragged further and further into a dark, dark world.The cinematography, casting, acting and most of all script/story are exceptional and easily stand comparison with the very best of either TV drama or movies.Guaranteed that you'll be straight on to series 2 and 3, you'll be astonished how an already exceptional program just gets better and better. The end of series 3 is one of the most extraordinary cliffhangers I've ever seen.Buy it. Definitely. Now.

  We bought this DVD as I had heard so much about it.  Well all the recommendations were right.  It is very addictive.  We have just commenced the next set Season 2. Not all episodes are gripping and leave you wanting more, however I understand that it just gets better as you watch it.. I personally like the 'black' humour that runs through, and the twists and turns that the main character faces and manages to pull off.  I would certainly recommend it based on what I have seen so far.

  The first episode is a masterpiece and the rest of the Series does not let up.

  I enjoyed this series and will look forward to more seasons of Breaking Bad. There is an intelligence to the storyline that engages the viewer and rather than falling back on sensationalism, which would be easy considering the subject matter of crystal methamphetamine, the human condition is the focus. Well worth watching.

  I seem to be in a minority of one when it comes to assessing the merits of Breaking Bad - I don't believe it deserves all of the accolades it gets in terms of being one of the greatest shows ever made. However to be clear - this is a good TV show. It's just not in the same league as The Wire and Game of Thrones.I confess that I abandoned BB midway through the second season. Mainly because I decided I had better things to do then get depressed by its unrelenting bleakness. My problem was that I was unconvinced by the extreme decisions Walter White made: I just didn't buy the fact that, knowing he was dying an intelligent and compassionate man would value making money to support his family after he was gone, at such a cost to his very soul, above spending the little remaining time he had with said family. Sure, some characters would do that: but what we learn about Walter's values and principles made the road that he takes seem inauthentic.In terms of epic crime drama nothing can touch The Wire, not even Breaking Bad.

  A good watch and enjoyed Series 1, but thought extending to 5 series might turn out to be heavy going.  Successful TV seriesseem to stretch on forever and become a bit of a 'cash-cow'.  'Lost' was an example of this, but 'Heroes', 'Homeland', 'Boardwalk Empire', 'House' and perhaps now 'Downton Abbey' seem to go on forever, losing their way, but because they sell abroad, particularly in the all-important American market, they always seem to run to one, or more, series too many.

  2009? I watched one episode of this. Then got my kids (all of them old enough, don't worry) to watch it. And I tell you folks, nothing that year came close to this series, and we are all unreconstructed Doctor Who fans from the old school (whatever that means) and we were all totally in thrall to this amazing series.Who is Brian Cranston? Don't know, but he deserves each and every award that he has received, been nominated for, and if there aren't any he hasn't got and you think he should have, for goodness sake get creative and INVENT one. Same goes for whathisface Gilligan and everyone else.Where one earth do I start?Maybe it's the deconstruction and disassembly of the American Dream.Walter, a gifted chemistry teacher, one day wakes up and finds out that his persistent cough is lung cancer. That would be bad enough, but his circumstances are such that he is far more terrified about the future than any normal person would be given his diagnosis. The story is basically what he is prepared to do to try to make a future for his wife, his teenage son and his baby (who is about to arrive).So far so good. But what a merry dance we are led into. We are tempted to believe that Walt really is very unfortunate, but as the series progresses, and believe me, it does so in fine style, we start to see faint but unmistakable inconsistencies in this apparent series of facts; we see (for instance) that his son is actually very intelligent, far from being helpless, he's a one of the series' strongest characters, and so it goes on - what really IS driving Walt?What is REALLY going on?I'll let you find out.I don't know where to begin with the enormous questions that the series raises. I remember my old drama teacher telling us that the purpose of drama was to knock you on the head and make you think, make you laugh, to assault you and not let you get up for at least a while. What is the source of Walt's dissolution? Is it the nature of what America has turned into? Who are his real friends? Why does he feel poor? What is the American Dream? Who pays for it? And what is it's eventual disposition?Whatever the answers, you will not be disappointed with this sucker, that, I promise. I want to meet this guy Walt some day, even if it is the last thing I ever do.Very, very powerful and often very funny too.Highly recommended.

  レビュータイトルどおりで、脚本に詰めが甘い箇所はわりとあったりしますが、それでも本筋の展開の進み方が興味を惹きます。なので、シーズンを進めるごとに面白みが湧いてくるのではないかなと思われます。私は現在はシーズン３の途中でだいたい全体の6割位見終わった感じですが（シーズン4，5は既に購入して観る準備はしています）、シーズン１のディスク１はちょっとかったるい感じがするかと思いますが、ディスク２，３で監督が代わっていたりしてその辺りから徐々に展開にテンポが出てきます。日本にいて多少にアメリカから入ってくるニュースを知っている程度の予備知識でも十分分かりやすい内容になっていると思います（私は一時期アメリカの西のほうに住んでいましたが、まあアルバカーキはこんな感じですし（やや田舎）、ドラマが放送された2008～2013年のオバマ政権下でのアメリカもまあこんな感じというか、アメリカ人（とくに田舎のアメリカ人）ってこういう考え方かな、と思いますので、その辺りに興味がある方が観るのもいいかもしれません）。まだシーズン３ですが、4，5を既に購入するくらいですので（ファイナルも購入予定です）、私自身このドラマの展開にはわりと興味深いものを感じています。映画のようにスピーディーですっごくダイナミックな展開の仕方というのはないのですが、逆にややスローな展開であるがゆえに現実感も伴っているかな、とも思われます。/*---------------------追記2019年5月10日(金)です。ファイナルシーズンまで観終わりました。大きな視点で言いますとこのブレイキング・バッドは観て良かったです。やはり惹き込まれる魅力は多々あります。ですが、矛盾な点もわりとあります。特に、シーズン５に入ってからはこれまでのスリリングな見せ場にもインパクトがやや欠け、このシーズンを終わらせる為なのか矛盾な点も多くなっていきます。凄く気になる矛盾点もシーズン５に入ってから顕著でした。ですので、その辺りが残念だなと思った次第です。シーズン４が終わった状況からシーズン５でこの物語をジ・エンドまで持っていくには無理があったようにも感じます。その無理が結構大きな矛盾をいくつか生んでしまいながらもストーリーは進めなくてはならなかったのかな？　という印象でしょうか。ですので、私の個人的なレーティングとしてはシーズン4を観終わった時点では星4.5かなというのが、シーズン５の顕著な矛盾でストーリーが粗くなってしまった為、トータル的には3.5といったところでしょうか。つまり、シーズン５でシーズン４までのレーティングから-1を差し引く鑑賞感、というのが正直なところです。

  Une chose m'a frappé d'entrée de jeu dans le générique : l'utilisation des abréviations de la classification périodique des éléments dans les noms qui y apparaissent ! Du coup Breaking Bad est composé de Br pour Brome et de Ba pour Baryum : une chose est sûre on se trouve bien dans une série chimique ! L'alchimie va-t-elle s'opérer ?Dés les premiers instants, je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher de faire la comparaison avec Weeds tant les scénarios sont proches :* Mère de famille obligée de vendre (et cultiver) des produits illicites pour assurer le niveau de vie de sa famille après le décès de son époux / père de famille obligé de synthétiser de la Meth (et de la vendre) pour assurer le train de vie de sa famille après son décès annoncé (cancer du poumon).* Personnages au dessus de tout soupçon,* Importance des délits très minimisée par les scénaristes,* Ville du sud des états-unis* Petit ami de l'héroïne qui fait partie de la DEA / Beau-frère du héros qui fait partie de la DEA,* Acolytes un peu déjantés voire pas vraiment au niveau...* Acteurs principaux de GRAND talent (Mary-Louise Parker / Bryan Cranston)Bref, les points communs sont indéniables pourtant aucune des séries ne copie l'autre ! Dans Breaking Bad, les scénaristes vont plus loin, les limites sont vraiment repoussées à l'extrême et ce dés le début (la dissolution d'un dealer dans une baignoire remplie de produits chimiques en atteste !!!). Breaking Bad est une excellente série (un peu courte car seulement 7 épisodes pour la première saison), l'histoire est bien pensée, les acteurs sont vraiment bons, la narration est assez rythmée (même s'il y a quelques longueurs dans les tous premiers épisodes afin de placer l'histoire), le tout est vraiment agréable à suivre et laisse augurer une saison 2 riche en rebondissements.Ce qui fait de cette série une série atypique c'est, à mon sens, le ton général vraiment dérangeant, ça m'a rappelé un peu le côté décalé de ""six feet under""...

  Abgesehen von Breaking Bad bin ich ein Fan von ""True Blood"", ""Queer as folk"", ""Californication"". Auch ""The Shield"" finde ich recht gut. In Breaking Bad geht es um einen armen und selbstunsicheren Chemielehrer, Walter White, der erfährt, dass er Krebs und nicht mehr lange zu leben hat. Er will unbedingt seine Familie finanziell absichern und beginnt, mit Hilfe eines ehemaligen Schülers Crystal Meth herzustellen und zu verkaufen. Es kommt zu allerlei Verwicklungen, nicht zuletzt, weil sein Schwager beim Drogendezernat der Polizei ist. Besonders gelungen finde ich die Serie, nicht nur wegen der (An-)Spannung (man wird total in Atem gehalten!), sondern auch weil die Entwicklung der Charaktere so gemacht ist, dass es bei den Hauptfiguren keinen ""nur guten"" oder ""nur Bösen"" gibt. Manchmal identifiziert man sich mit Walter, der Anfangs der Typ ""Antiheld"" ist, manchmal mit einer der anderen Figuren. Jedenfalls ist man immer emotional beteiligt und die Geschichte wird nie flach. Was die Serie auch so gut macht, ist, dass es sich um eine fortlaufende Geschichte handelt, also wie ein genialer Film, der über 80 Stunden geht. Ich habe bisher die ersten 4 Staffeln gesehen und warte sehnsüchtig auf die 5. Staffel. Ach ja: Wer die Sprache beherrscht, sollte sich die Serie natürlich unbedingt im Original ansehen!

  DVD 11. Der Einstieg (Pilot)Walter White (Bryan Cranston) ist für viele seiner Mitmenschen eine Lachnummer und ein Loser. Der Chemielehrer hat es nicht einfach in seinem Leben. An der Schule verdient er kaum was, sein Sohn ist behindert. Seine schöne Frau Skyler (Anna Gunn) ist schwanger und versucht der Familie mit Verkäufen von Habseligkeiten über das Internet über Wasser zu halten. Um die Familie irgendwie zu unterstützen, hat er einen Zweitjob in einer Autowaschanlage. Peinlich genug, dass er miesen Kerlen wie seinem Schüler Chad, der im Unterricht noch nie was um ihn gegeben hat, den Luxuswagen waschen muss. Zudem kommt, dass Walt seit einiger Zeit ein Husten quält. Er bricht in der Waschanlage zusammen und wird ins Krankenhaus gebracht. Da er nicht raucht, sind die Lungengeräusche verdächtig. Es stellt sich heraus, dass er an einer unheilbaren Form von Lungenkrebs leidet. Er will seine Familie unterstützen. Da sein Schwager Drogencop ist und er das Knowhow hat kommt ihm eine fragwürdige Idee...> Der Pilotfilm macht Lust auf mehr. Er zeigt, wie aus einem Loser, der eigentlich immer nur die Regeln befolgt hat und dafür vom Leben einen Tritt in den Hintern bekommen hat aufgrund einer todbringenden Krankheit seine Familie weiterhin versorgt wissen will. Als einziger Ausweg bleibt ihm da nur in kürzester Zeit, eine Menge Kohle zu verdienen… Bryan Cranston, den ich bislang davor nur aus Malcolm mittendrin kannte, spielt die Rolle bravourös.> Bemerkenswert für eine Serie sind die expliziten Sexdarstellungen unter der Bettdecke oder nackte Brüste.2. Die Katze ist im Sack…Nachdem Walt und sein notgedrungener Partner von dessen „Geschäftspartnern“ bedroht wurden und sich Walt seines Lebens erwehrt hat, geht er davon aus, dass die beiden durch die chemische Reaktion gestorben sind. Allerdings lebt einer von ihnen noch… Wohin mit der Leiche? Und wohin mit dem Überlebenden?3. …und der Sack ist im FlussNachdem die eine Leiche aufgelöst ist, gibt es immer noch das Problem des Dealers. Die Lage spitzt sich zu, als sich Walts Frau Skyler einmischt.

Die DiagnoseWalts Frau Skyler lässt die Bombe auf einer Familienfeier platzen. Sein Schwager und Skylers Schwester sichern ihm bzw. ihr die Hilfe zu, die sie benötigen. Aber Walt weiß auch, die Behandlung kostet Geld. Man sucht sich einen der 10 besten Onkologen der USA aus, der eine Behandlung vorschlägt. Natürlich trägt die Krankenkasse den Spezialisten nicht. Walt deckt die erste Anzahlung mit dem Drogengeld. Aber die Behandlung kostet 90.000 Dollar – als Einstieg!> Die Serie zeigt auch, dass ein kleiner Junkie und Drogendealer eine Vorgeschichte hat. Ungeschönt wird in den Vorepisoden die Entfernung der Leiche gezeigt. Man sollte also keine schwachen Nerven haben.> Der Originaltitel Cancer Man ist eine Anspielung auf X Files und dem Krebskandidaten.> Der BMW, der in der Episode hochgejagt ist, ist nicht funktionsfähig gewesen.5. GrauzonenNachdem er bei seinen Eltern rausgeflogen ist, obwohl er nichts getan hat, versucht Jesse dieses Mal auf ehrliche Art und Weise Geld zu verdienen. Er tritt souverän im Vorstellungsgespräch auf, gerät aber wieder in die falschen Kreise. Sein Partner Walt möchte mit ihm auch nichts mehr zu tun haben. Ihn hatte er bereits gefragt, ob er für ihn wieder Crystal kochen möchte. Auf einer Party trifft er einen Ex-Partner, dem er eigentlich damals auf seine Erfolgsschiene gebracht hat. Der bietet Walt eine Lösung für alle Probleme an, doch Walt lehnt aus Stolz ab. Schließlich war das alles seine Idee und wäre auch seine Firma gewesen…6. In der Höhle des LöwenWalt ist auf der Suche nach einem Zwischenhändler, da Jesse das Meth nur in kleinen Mengen verticken kann. Da der erste Zwischenhändler tot ist wendet er sich über seinen Freund an Tuco. Der will das Zeug jedoch nur in Kommission verticken und schlägt Jesse zusammen.

  Too much hype over this series left me wondering why I felt obliged to carry on to watch Series 2 when I only liked bits of it.  I perservered and ultimately regretted it.  The main character has no real redeeming features to make you want to follow his trials and tribulations.  Some interesting plots make the first Series okay but nothing more.

  Ich bin von Walking Dead auf Breaking Bad gestossen (wegen AMC) und die Serie machte mich neugierig, da ich NUR gute Rezensionen und Bewertungen überall gelesen habe. Ich muss sagen, dass ich die erste Staffel blind gekauft habe, ohne Trailer oder sonstiges vorher zu sehen, da ich Spoilers absolut vermeiden wollte.Nun möchte ich natürlich überhaupt nichts verraten, aber mein Gott! Die Serie steigerte sich immer mehr und mehr bis zum 4. Staffel. Es gibt keine einzige langweilige Folge, im Vergleich zu anderen Serien, einfach wahnsinn!! Mittlerweile bin ich schon komplett von dieser Serie besessen und kann die 5. Staffel nicht mehr abwarten, was leider auch die letzte sein wird.Da ich wie gesagt nichts verraten möchte, kann ich nur als Empfehlung sagen, dass wer auf Scarface, Mafia und Drogenfilme steht, aber auch wenn nicht, muss diese Serie einfach gucken und am besten in Originalfassung, denn die Charaktere haben alle sehr markante Stimmen. Ganz besonders die Stimme von Jesse und seine Sprüche. Ich habe kurz die Dt. Fassung angeschaut, aber nö, geht garnicht. Es gibt einfach bestimmte Ausdrücke und Witze, die man niemals genauso synchronisiert rüberbringen kann.Der Hauptdarsteller Bryan Cranston hat schon drei Emmys als beste Hauptdarsteller von 2008 - 2010 gewonnen. Er spielt die Rolle aber auch wirklich sehr gut, alleine nur die Gesichtsausdrücke und Mimik. Sein Nebendarsteller Aaron Paul war in den drei Jahren nominiert und hat dann letztes Jahr auch endlich den Emmy gewonnen als beste Nebendarsteller.Die Aufnahmen, die Bilderfarben der Landschaften und die Kameraführung sind Kinoreif. Es gibt viele Shockmomente und eigentlich, kann man nie vorausahnen, was als nächstes kommt. Zum Glück habe ich die Serie spät entdeckt. So konnte ich mich auf die Staffel 1-4 richtig freuen (habe sie auch alle anschliessend gekauft - Staffel 4 bei iTunes). Ich habe sie alle dann innerhalb 1 1/2 Wochen reingezogen (natürlich nicht durchgehend, da man ja noch zwischendurch zur Arbeit muss). Man kann einfach nicht aufhören. Jetzt schaue ich sie mir alle wieder an.Ich war eigentlich nie, mit Ausnahme von Star Trek TNG, ein Serienfan gewesen, da es immer wieder nervte, wenn man auf die nächste Folge warten muss. Komischer Weise ist es auch ein Vorteil. Denn ein Film z.B. packt die Story innerhalb 2 Std. oder 3 bei Überlänge und das war es dann auch. Bei Serien, haben die Charaktere und Story die Möglichkeit sich weiter zu entwickeln. Ich habe auch gelesen, dass renommierte Regisseure mittlerweile auch schon Richtung TV Serien wandern, da sie was Kreativität angeht, mehr Freiheit und Spielraum haben.Mein Tipp falls Ihr die Serie noch nie gesehen habt -- bitte keine Vorschau und ähnliches, auch kein Youtube anschauen. Lasst Euch einfach überraschen. Keine Spoilers oder Foren lesen und unbedingt in Originalfassung anschauen, falls Ihr englisch gut versteht.

  Als ich mir die Serie zum ersten Mal abgehackt bei Arte im Spätprogramm angesehen habe, hat sie mich anfangs eigentlich gar nicht erreicht. Mit jeder weiteren Folge wurde mir dann aber bewusst, um welch außergewöhnliche Arbeit es sich hier handelt. Das Tempo der Serie entschleunigt erstmal die normalen Sehgewohnheiten des Zuschauers, um dann akzentuiert thematisch hart zu wechseln. Die einzelnen Einstellungen vermitteln den Eindruck man sitze neben den Darstellern auf einem Sofa und lausche einem belanglosen Alltagserlebnis. Nach einiger Zeit vermittelt das die Illusion man sitze nicht vor dem Fernsehapparillo, sondern man partizipiere am Plot. Die dargestellten Ereignisse sind fein beobachtet und in diesem Szenario neu arrangiert. Ein mir bekannter Filmproduzent hat berichtet, dass sowohl die Kamaratechik als auch die Gesamtkosten der Folgen als außergewöhnlich bezeichnet werden müssten. Charakterisierend für die Fernsehproduktion von AMC ist allerdings, dass einem dies zu Beginn gar nicht bewusst wird, weil die Serie mit einem absoluten Understatement arbeitet! Für Serienfans höherer Wertigkeit ein Muss!

  My brother told me about this series several weeks ago. I initially scoffed. A ""dark comedy"" about a dying high school chemistry teacher who turns to producing meth in order to provide for his family...with the main character being played by the dad from Malcolm in the Middle? I thought the premise was odd and the casting suspect. How wrong I was.I'm quite choosy with TV shows--one has to be, with the glut of choices available. I took a chance on Breaking Bad and was completely hooked. As others have stated in their reviews, everything from the dialogue, to the cinematography, to the plot, to the acting makes for a cringe-inducing, mesmerizing, guffaw-producing gem. The lead actors (Bryan Cranston of M in the M fame and Aaron Paul) are phenomenal. Breaking Bad is completely worthy of the praise it's earned and so much more.

  Ein lahmer Chemielehrer lebt mit Frau und Sohn in einem beschaulichen Vorort von Albuquerque, New Mexico. Klingt ja ziemlich öde. Dann aber wird bei Walter White Lungenkrebs im Endstadium diagnostiziert - damit ist seine Welt von heute auf morgen auf den Kopf gestellt. Eine Therapie ist natürlich sehr teuer, und als Lehrer und nebenbei Autowäscher verdient man ohne Krankenversicherung eben nicht genug. Daher muss schnellstens eine Lösung her: Als Walter seinen Schwager Hank, der bei der Polizei arbeitet, bei der Aushebung eines Drogenlabors begleitet, sieht er seinen ehemaligen Schüler Jesse Pinkmann aus einem Nebengebäude flüchten. Er erkennt da natürlich einen Zusammenhang, und so sucht Mr. White seinen Ex-Schüler in seinem Haus auf. Er erklärt ihm, dass er ihn sofort verpfeifen werden - wenn er nicht mit ihm Drogen koche. So beginnt eine der besten Serien, die ich bis jetzt gesehen habe. Sowohl Bryan Cranston - bestens bekannt als Familenvater Hal in ""Malcolm mittendrin"" als auch Aaron Paul liefern eine schauspielerische Glanzleistung ab und machen die Serie noch besser, als sie bereits ist. Das Drehbuch ist sehr gut geschrieben und es kommt eigentlich nie richtig Langeweile auf. Ich bin sehr gespannt auf die weiteren Staffeln und hoffe, diese sind ebenso gut wie die erste.

  Ich bewerte hier die Blu-Ray der ersten Staffel von Breaking Bad, falls Amazon wieder alle Rezesionen zusammen wirft.Zunächst einmal möchte ich klar stellen, das ich in Vergangenheit nicht der allzu große Serienfreak war.Eigentlich gönne ich mir immer nur diese typischen Comedyserien die im Free-TV rauf und runter laufen.Two and a half Man, King of Quenns oder The Big bang Theory waren daher immer meine lieblingsserien.Da Breaking Bad meistens immer auf Nebensendern oder im Pay-TV ausgestrahlt wurde, ging sie anscheinend spurlos an mir vorbei. Obwohl viele Bekannte oder Kollegen ständig von dieser Serie schwärmten und sie bis in den Himmel lobten, hielt sich mein Interesse trotzdem in Grenzen was Breaking Bad anging. So ganz nach dem Motto: ""Was der Bauer nicht kennt, das isst er nicht"".Als dann eines Tages ein guter Kumpel auch von dieser Serie erzählte und mir sagte, dass es das geilste ist, was er je gesehen hat, wurde schließlich auch ich neugierig. Er erklärte mir grob die Grundstory und schwupps ging mir diese Serie nicht mehr aus den Kopf. Langsam wagte ich also auch mal den ersten Schritt.Falls die Serie mir doch nicht gefällt, kaufte ich mir daher nur erstmal die erste Staffel.Ich will ja kein Geld sinnlos aus dem Fenster werfen, denn schließlich kaufte ich mir dieses Produkt blind.Aber ich muss sagen ich wurde keinesfalls enttäuscht.-Zur Story:Der Chemielehrer Walther White, bekommt eines Tages Lugenkrebs im Endstadium diagnostiziert.Zu Hause sitzt seine Schwangere Frau, die selber nicht arbeitstätig ist und sein behinderter Sohn.Weil auf dem Haus noch Hypotheken laufen, ist das Geld der Familie natürlich knapp. Walther braucht also schnell viel Geld um seine teure Krebsbehandlung bezahlen zu können. Er befürchtet allerdings das er bald sterben wird, deshalb möchte er auch für seine Familie vorsorgen, damit er ihr nach seinem Ableben noch viel Geld hinterlassen kann.Aus diesem Grund schließt er sich mit seinem ehemaligen Schüler Jesse Pinkman zusammen um Crystal Meth herzustellen. Walther kennt die Chemie um die Droge zu Kochen und Jesse kennt sich im Drogenmarkt aus um das Zeug zu verkaufen.Jesse und Walther besorgen sich daher einen Campingwagen, sämtliche Kochutensilien und alle benötigten chemichen Mittel.Sie fahren in die Wüste von New Mexiko, kochen dort ihre illegalen Drogen und verkaufen sie dann an mexikanische Drogenbosse.Sehr schnell verdienen sie ihr Geld.Ein perfektes Geschäft eigentlich, wäre da nicht Walther's Schwager Hank, der bei der Drogenbehörde (DEA) arbeitet.Walther muss sein gefährliches Doppelleben daher vor seiner Familie, vor Hank und vor allem vor der Drogenbehörde geheim halten.-Meine Meinung:Breaking Bad ist eine Serie mit Nervenkitzel und mit extrem viel Spannung. In jeder einzelnen Folge wird man als Zuschauer auf die Folter gespannt. Im Prinzip kann man diese Serie als einen sehr sehr langen Spielfilm bezeichen, der in mehrere Parts aufgeteilt ist. Denn jede einzelne Folge, knüpft genau da an, wo die vorherige aufgehört hat. Daher möchte man immer wissen wie es weiter geht und wird an diese Serie gefesselt. Es ist echt einzigartig wie es die Produzenten geschafft haben, von Folge zu folge so viel Spannung auf zu bauen.Die Freigabe ab 16 Jahren ist aber gerechtfertigt, da der Konsum und die Herstellung von Drogen gezeigt werden.Außerdem kommt es des öfteren zu Schießereien und vielen anderen ekelhaften Gewaltszenen.Breaking Bad ist ein ernst zunehmender Thriller mit viel Drama, aber auch viel schwarzem Humor.Harmlose Comedyserien wie Two and a Half man kann man damit aber auf keinen Fall vergleichen.-Zur Blu-Ray:Das Bild und der Ton sind ""einigermaßen"" gut. Mir kommt es vor als ob das Bild an manschen Stellen ein bisschen rieselt.Vielleicht hätte man hier bei der Umsetzung zur Blu-Ray ein bisschen was drann machen können. Aber naja ich kenne den Vergleich zur DVD nicht, daher bin ich eigentlich noch zufrieden.Es gibt mehrere Tonspuren, die Serie kann also auch im englischen OT genoßen werden.Außer entfallenen Szenen, einem Making Of der Serie, beietet die BD noch einiges Bonusmaterial. Alles Sehenswert!-Zur Bewertung:Diese Serie ist, wie jeder sagt, einfach einzigartig.Ich kann sie nur jedem empfehlen. Wer diese Serie nicht mag, der hat echt keinen Geschmack.Ich zumindest werde hier sehr gut unterhalten und bin jetz mitterweile schon bei Staffel 3 angelang.Diese Serie ist eine Sucht und ein muss für jeden Film- und Serienfreak.Ich gebe hier alle 5 Sterne und muss eine klare Kaufempfehlung aussprechen.

  全シリーズ視聴済み。とにかく主人公の置かれた状況がどうなって行くのか、先が気になって仕方ない。ある意味、「先を気にさせる事のみを優先した」あざといシナリオ作りなんだけど、主人公への感情移入と展開のテンポの良さが相まって、ラストシーズンまで一気に見てしまった。常に「自分だったらどうしただろう」と考えさせられます。パッケージがコメディっぽいので敬遠している人もいるかも知れませんが、基本的に全編シリアスなサスペンスドラマです。あまりピンと来なかった人も、このシーズンだけで判断せず、シーズン２くらいまで見て欲しいです。どんどん状況の緊迫感が増して行き、主人公の結末がどうなるか予測の付かない展開に見るのを止められなくなります。

  Ich habe mir noch nie eine TV- Serie als DVD/ BlueRay zugelegt, weil ich bislang immer der Meinung war, das es sich dabei nur um leichtverdauliche Massenwahre handelt die man nach einmaligem sehen schnell wieder vergessen kann.Durch einen Artikel im Internet wurde ich auf diese Serie aufmerksam, suchte weitere Informationen, sah mir Teaser und Trailer an und schaute bei Amazon.de nach Verfügbarkeit und Bewertungen. Die Bestellung und Lieferung waren, natürlich, kein Problem und ich wartete auf BrBa mit leichten Bauchschmerzen (Überbewertet? Fehlkauf? Krebs? Drogen? Gehöre ich überhaupt zur Zielgruppe?).Aber diese leichten Zweifel wurden schon ab der ersten Folge wie weg geweht. Die Ausgangspostion der Charaktere, ihre Entwicklungen, die Verwicklungen, verfahrene, komische und dramatische Situationen haben mich von der ersten Minute an gefesselt. Am Ende jeder Folge (inzwischen auch jeder Staffel) MUSSTE ich wissen wie es weitergeht mit Walter, Jesse & Co.Der Umgang mit den beiden Schwerpunktthemen (Krebs und Drogen) ist jederzeit präsent, aber diese Themen werden vernünftig dargestellt (kleiner Spoiler: die Situation, in der Walter seine Familie über seine Erkrankung aufklärt, war sehr beeindruckend.). Man bekommt Zugang zu den möglichen Ursachen (Drogen), Möglichkeiten der persönlichen Verarbeitung (Krebs), lernt eine Menge über das Leben im Süden der USA und die dortige Gesundheitspolitik.Ein sehr empfehlenswerter Kauf, Unterhaltung garantiert.

  BREAKING BAD ist eine aussergewöhnliche Serie, sowohl vom plot als auch von den schauspielerischen Leistungen her. Der einzige störende Aspekt, der zu einem Punktabzug von 0,5 Punkten führt (kann man leider nicht direkt eingeben), ist die dämliche, exzessiv eingesetzte WACKELkamera ...

  Aufgrund des ganzen Breaking Bad Hypes habe ich lange überlegt ob ich diese Serie gucken soll.  Im Prinzip wird einem die Serie ja schon aufgedrängt, beinahe schon auf eine lästige Art und Weise.Irgendwann habe ich aus Interesse einfach mal eine Staffel gekauft und muss sagen ich war von Anfang an gefesselt.Man sollte die Serie aber im Originalton gucken und sich zur Not Untertitel einstellen, es wirkt einfach um ein vielfaches besser. Geniale Serie, eine der besten die ich bisher gesehen habe.Achtung : Wer auf eine Comedylastige Serie hofft wird hier enttäuscht, viel eher wird ein melancholisches Stimmungsbild geschaffen  welches auch noch Stunden nachdem der Fernseher aus ist nachwirkt.

  I'm afraid I never caught the bug ! Rather ridiculous plot line with characters who you can take or leave. My work colleagues, who seem to be able to wax lyrical about this series ( but then again they all think Game of Thrones is 'great' too), think I am simply being perverse in my assessment of this series, but I am not. I also own series two, but can offer no comment upon it...........or indeed anything beyond the start of episode 3 of series one. Enough said.

  Ich bin kein Serienkonsument. Ich habe es nie gemocht, wie einfache Ideen Staffel um Staffel gestreckt werden, so lange die Einschaltquoten stimmen. Es wird hier nicht so lange erzählt, bis eine Geschichte zu Ende ist, sondern bis die Zitrone restlos ausgequetscht ist. Zudem gefällt mir der Look, die Qualität, das Aussehen bei Serien nicht. Ich ziehe immer einen guten Spielfilm vor. Last but not least: ich möchte meine Abende nicht von einer TV-Ausstrahlung bestimmt sehen.Einzig Stromberg und Pastewka sind Serien, die ich mir anschaue. Aber auch im Kino finde ich immer seltener Filme, die mich ansprechen. Die hundertste X-Men Folge oder irgendeine Superhelden-Verfilmung... damit kann ich nichts anfangen. Mein letzter guter Kinofilm ist lange her und war Django Unchained. Dies nur um meinen Geschmack ein wenig einschätzen zu können, damit Sie wiederum einschätzen können, ob meine Rezension für Sie Gewicht hat oder nicht.Ich gebe wenig auf Hypes. Genauso wenig, wie ich aktuelle Musik im Radio hören kann, genausowenig gefällt mir meistens, was von allen gemocht wird. Ist einfach so. Nicht immer, aber oft. So bin ich wohl einer der wenigen Menschen, die ""The Walking Dead"" als ein ultralangweiliges GZSZ-Format empfinden. Aber immer mehr Menschen sprachen begeistert von Breaking Bad, sodass ich doch neugierig wurde. Habe mir die 1. Staffel gekauft und war sofort in ihrem Bann. Ich war noch nicht begeistert, sprach nicht von einem Meisterwerk oder gar eine de besten Serien. Aber ich war doch stark genug von der Geschichte, den Figuren und dem Setting fasziniert, dass ich mir sogleich Staffel 2 - 4 bestellte. Nun habe ich die 2. Staffel durch. Es waren schlimme 3 Abende. Schlimm, weil ich um halb 2h Morgens mich jedes Mal zwingen musste, abzuschalten und am Folgetag weiterzuschauen.Die Anfänge jeder Serie sind ein Kunstwerk. Sie zeigen einem, für den Zuschauer in dem Moment, unfassbare Szenen, die er  nicht mit seinem Bild des Fortgangs der Serie vereinbaren kann. Die manchmal aber recht banal aufgelöst werden. Aber es erzeugt Spannung. Nicht zu knapp. Und dann die mehrmalige Vorankündigung des Finales...Ist der geniale Anfang vorbei, nimmt die Serie immer sofort Fahrt auf. Folgt dem Ende der vorausgegangenen Folge und die Drehbuchautoren schaffen es, in nahezu jede Folge überraschende Höhepunkte einzubauen. Es gibt keine Folge, die nicht nur gefällt, sondern auch fasziniert. Und jede Serie endet mit einem Cliffhänger, der einen sofort die kommende Folge anschauen lässt (deshalb nie im TV schauen - immer nur auf DVD/Bluray). Es sind aber keine billigen Cliffhänger. Sondern manchmal sogar sehr subtile Szenen.Dass die Schauspieler top besetzt sind, muss ich sicher nicht extra erwähnen. Dass das Setdesign perfekt ist und die Filmlocations großartig sind, wohl auch nicht. Gut, die Frau nervt ein wenig. Wobei das untertrieben ist. Weiß nicht, ob das so gewollt ist. Wenn wir bei den Dingen sind, die mir nicht so ganz gefallen: in der Folge mit Tucco verhalten sich die Protagonisten wirklich extrem dumm und unbeholfen, sodass der Zuschauer gleich merkt, warum welche Fehler gemacht werden, um später wider Spannung in die Serie zu bringen. Da kam ich mir ein wenig verarscht vor. Aber auch wenn ich das in die Bewertung der Serie mit einfliessen lasse, bleibt es bei 4.999999999 Punkten! :-)Um zum Ende zu kommen: die Staffel 2 ist nochmal eine extreme Steigerung im Vergleich zur 1. Staffel. Jeder, der die 1. Staffel gut fand, MUSS sich die 2. ansehen. Spätestens dann, wird man auf die Serie genauso scharf, wie die Drogenszene in der Serie auf Heisenbergs Crystal Meth. Ich freue mich heute Abend schon wieder auf den Feierabend! Und auf die Staffel 3 und 4, die auch zu Hause liegen. Vor der Phase nach der Serie graut mir, wie einem Drogenuser vorm Entzug.

  Ich hatte mir lange vorgenommen, Breaking Bad endlich einmal zu schauen. Dann habe ich mir die erste Staffel gekauft und nun ja, ich konnte den Hype nicht ganz verstehen. Während ich in der ersten Episode noch ziemlich mitgerissen war, desto schwerer war es in den nächsten drei, vier Folgen wirklich dran zu bleiben, da sich alles doch sehr zog. Es ist natürlich anzumerken, dass dies dem Drama sehr hilft, da es dadurch einfacher wird, die Charaktere kennenzulernen und man später, wenn es zur Sache geht, eher mit ihnen mitfühlen kann. Na ja, außer bei Skyler, die nervt ab dem Moment in der sie in Folge eins den Mund aufmacht. Hank ist auch relativ nervig, aber er geht einen nicht so tierisch auf den Sack wie Skyler. Die anderen Charaktere wirken allesamt wesentlich sympathischer, vor allem Walter und Jesse, denen man ihr Drama sofort abkauft und man fängt schnell an, mit ihnen Mitleid zu haben. Gegen Ende der Staffel nimmt die Handlung dann auch wieder etwas an Fahrt auf und in Staffel zwei scheint die Geschwindigkeit dann auch konstant hoch zu bleiben.FAZIT: Guter Einstieg in die Serie, sehr gute Einführung der Charaktere, gutes Drama, aber sehr streckend teilweise, daher nur vier Sterne von fünf.

  This show is just plain awesome. It's about a boring high school Chemistry teacher who develops Cancer and decides to make drugs to support his pregnant wife and son who lives with cerebral palsy. I believe the reason the show is so good is because of how it tests the viewers morality, and asks if it alright to do bad things for good reasons. Highly recommended.

  Voir absolument cette série originale, intelligente et drôle (humour noir). Les acteurs sont formidables. La série tire partie du rapprochement de 2 univers très différents qui normalement ne se croisent jamais, celui d'une famille unie d'américains moyens (petite vie rangée et bons sentiments) avec celui de la pègre et de la drogue (crimes,  violence et avidité d'argent). La série montre comment le cancer, dans la société américaine, peut transformer un gentil petit prof de physique en un redoutable chef de gang, producteur de drogues dures. Pas  caricatural mais au contraire des personnages crédibles et attachants malgré l'horreur de ce qu'ils sont amenés à faire. Série à montrer aux ados, car elle fait prendre conscience de la réalité de la drogue et la déchéance qu'elle amène. Bon niveau d'anglais requis car pas de sous titres en français.

  Scoperta per caso, una delle migliori serie tv degli ultimi tempi. Anche se a tratti molto toccante.. Soprattutto per i temi toccati. Consigliatissima!!!

  すごい話題になって、主演の俳優さんも好きだから買いました。日本人だからかなあ。薬物のジョークが笑えない。おもしろいやり取りもあるんだけど、共感がイマイチ持てなかった。途中で止めたまま。良く出来ているから、すごいドラマなんだけど、重くなってきてしまい、ストレス発散に観たいときには向かなかったです。好みの違いです。

  Wenn ich Leute sehe die sagen Game of Thrones ist soooo unglaublich gut dann denke ich die spinnen! Ich hab mir die 1 Staffel angesehen und bin fast eingeschlafen,nichts besonderes.Breaking Bad hingegen baut ab der 1 Folge der 1. Staffel eine unglaubliche Spannung auf und sie steigt immer weiter an,diese ganze Geschichte und die Leistung der Schauspieler. Traurig nur das Game of Thrones eine gleich gute Bewertung bekommt wie Breaking Bad

"
  Meine Freundin und ich haben die komplette Serie quasi verschlungen und waren sowohl von der Story, der Schauspielkunst der Darsteller/Innen (Bryan Cranston gebührt ein Sonderlob, aber auch die anderen können durchweg überzeugen), den oft fast kunstvoll wirkenden, schönen Einstellungen (einige Wüsten- und Wolkenpanoramen und Zeitrafferaufnahmen sind atemberaubend gut gemacht) und nicht zuletzt Dank des unserer Ansicht nach sehr gelungenen und passenden Endes, komplett begeistert.Der Serie quillt förmlich vor Liebe, Perfektion und Detailversessenheit der Macher über und ist einfach purer, wenn auch manchmal ein bisschen härterer Spaß. Es gibt nur ein paar Folgen, die ein bisschen abfallen, hier ist mir die ein wenig später in der Serie vorkommende Folge ""Die Fliege"" (oder so) in negativer Erinnerung. Aber alle evtl. schwächeren Momente verblassen vor der Grandiosität des Gesamtkunstwerkes.Ein Tipp: Ich lege hier jedem die Serie auf Blu-Ray ans Herz, damit kommt das Ganze auf passender Hardware noch einmal so gut (die erste Season auf DVD habe ich einem Arbeitskollegen zum Anfixen geschenkt :-)).Und ein weiterer Tipp: Wenn es irgendwie geht, im Original gucken (also Englisch mit englischem Untertitel, falls man doch mal leo.org mit einem Wort bemühen muss). Die deutsche Synchronisation ist zwar nicht schlecht, aber, naja, das Original ist eben das Original und die Stimmen wirken einfach passender (wie sollte es auch anders sein?!) und überzeugender.Fazit: Wer Breaking Bad noch nicht gesehen hat, sofort kaufen, ansehen und begeistert sein!

  A friend told me I would be hooked on Breaking Bad after 10 minutes of watching the first episode.  He was right!I am along for the roller coaster ride all the way to season 5.

"
  Bryan Cranston plays an amazing part here, Walter is a Chemistry teacher with cancer, who just wants to earn a bit of cash for his family before he dies.That's where all the good aspirations stop, and he gets into the only business he's good at, mixing chemicals.Its hilarious the troubles he gets into being a good person performing a natural skill for him that only bad people seem to really appreciate!I'm as hooked as if this was crystal meth. Next purchase, the boxed set from 1 to however many there are, 6 I think.Don't think about it, buy it!Chris

  Wer Breaking Bad noch nicht kennt, dem sei gesagt, es wird endlich zeit diese Serie zu schauen.Ich bin kein Mensch der Serien schaut, abder Breaking Bad hat mich gepackt und ich habe nicht aufhören können die Serie zu schauen.Sie ist wahnsinnig Spannend un gut gedreht.Leider habe ich die Serie schon zu Ende geschaut. In ein paar Jahren werde ich sie sicher nochmal schauen.

  Breaking Bad è una serie bellissima. La sua forza sta nel riuscire a miscelare molti elementi che sembrano in contrasto riuscendo ad essere spesso ironica e mai banale. Gli elementi che eccellono sono la scrittura e l'interpretazione del protagonista ( specialmente se ascoltato in lingua originale ), il quale riesce a interpretare in maniera eccellente e indimenticabile un personaggio molto complesso.
",5
"
  Okay, ich muss gestehen, dass ich Brian Cranston bisher nur aus ""Malcolm - mittendrin"" kannte. Von ""Breaking Bad"" hatte ich immer wieder gelesen, dass es DIE Serie überhaupt sei. Deshalb habe ich mir die DVD(s) bestellt. Und ich muss sagen, dass ich nicht enttäuscht wurde.
",5
"
  Endlich kenne ich die Anfänge und es ist mit jeder weiteren Folge spannender. Es kommt einem vor wie eine Reality Show, in der man hineingezogen wird und son biss denkt was geht denn bei denen ab... Und dann geht es los und die Ereignisse überschlagen sich! Chemie zum anfassen und es ist alles so realistisch, wie aus dem Leben gegriffen! Beeindruckend!

  Ich bin begeistert.Ich muss sagen das ist eine der besten Serien, die ich je gesehen habe.Auf mehreren Internetseiten, die sich mit Filmkritiken auseinandersetzen erfuhr ich von Breaking Bad. Die kurze Inhaltsangabe zur Serie weckte bei mir schonmal Interesse und als ich dann noch die guten Rezensionen hier bei Amazon las bestellte ich die erste Staffel.Nach kurzer Versandzeit war das Paket da und noch am selben Tag habe ich mir alle Folgen angeschaut.Selten hat mich eine Serie so überzeugt wie diese hier. Das liegt daran, dass ich mit vielen TV-Serien die zur Prime Time laufen nichts anfangen kann. Mich nervt das ständige Gedudel von Balladen um Emotionen zu erzeugen bzw. die Hektik, die die Handlung voran bringen soll (wie bei CSI...). Nicht, dass ich das alles so schlecht finde, aber es bietet eben keine Abwechslung.Und da ist Breaking Bad die Ausnahme. Hier wird der Spannungsbogen nämlich ganz allmählich aufgebaut, dafür dann aber umso besser und heftiger. So gibt es oft Szenen mit ruhigen Passagen ohne Musikgedudel, die sich voll auf die Charaktere konzentrieren, sodass man sich auf diese sehr gut einstellen kann. Man beginnt sich richtig für die handelnden Charaktere zu interessieren. Natürlich wird Musik eingesetzt und wenn dann auch perfekt und passend (zum Beispiel wenn die Drogenfahndung eine Razzia bei einem Dealer durchführt). Trotz der ruhigen Szenen wird es auf keinen Fall langweilig, da man so mehr Zeit hat sich auf die Personen einzustellen und die Spannung parallel perfekt hochgeschraubt wird. Was ich versuche zu erklären ist, dass Braking Bad vor allem durch seine einzigartige Atmosphäre zu überzeugen weiß.Mich zumindest hat es überzeugt und ich habe schon die zweite Staffel bestellt.

  In Kürze:Der brave Chemie-Lehrer Walter White beginnt ein Doppelleben in der Drogenkriminalität.Genialer Start-Up einer genialen Serie. Mit dem Opening der ersten Folge hat mich die Serie sofort in ihren Bann gezogen.Absolut sehens- und empfehlenswert.Die Blu-ray ist jeden einzelnen Cent wert!

"
  Eine Serie die süchtig macht und die ich jedem nur empfehlen kann, der auf der Such nach einer der besten Serien ist. Ich kann nur jedem der auf der Suche nach einer fesselnden Serie, mit spannender Handlung, tollen Schauspielern und Charakteren ist Breaking Bad empfehlen. Ich habe mich seiner Zeit dazu entschlossen die Blue Rays zukaufen, um in den Vollen Genuss zukommen, ohne Werbung.Schade ist nur das auch die schönste Serie irgendwann vorbei ist, bei keiner Serie war ich so traurig, dass es ein Ende gab. Zum Glück gibt es ja noch Nachschub mit ""Better Call Saul"".Von mir gibt es 5 Sterne, ich würde auch mehr geben, wenn ich könnte.

  Si no has visto esta serie, ya estás tardando en comprarla. Se merece la edición en blu-ray y esperemos que no tarden mucho en sacar las temporadas 3,4 y 5 primera parte.

  Benissimo tutto: qualità, consegna, serie TV. Non do 5 stelle solo perchè questa prima serie nonostante abbia la metà degli episodi delle serie successive (Solo 7 contro le 14 delle successive...) costa uguale! Per il resto come detto tutto OK!

"
  Mittlerweile haben wir alle Folgen gekauft, weil die Serie einfach der Knaller ist. Auf Empfehlung haben wir uns diese erste Folge gekauft um einmal reinzuschnuppern und sind nun vollauf begeistert. Die Serie ist nicht unbedingt für den Chemie-Unterricht förderlich auch wenn der Chemie-Lehrer einer war der sie uns empfohlen hat! Auch ist die Serie nicht für Kinder unter 16 geeignet, aber unser Ältester (17) ist auch begeistert und wir haben schöne Stunden zusammen vor dem TV, da ja da auch nicht wirklich tolles läuft.

  Also ich muss mal eins sagen,ab der 2.-3. Folge Breaking Bad, wusste ich mich hats erwischt.Ich bin süchtig!Ich kann nicht mehr aufhören mir die Sendung rund um den Drogenkoch Walter White alias Heissenberg, seinem Kompanen Jessy, seiner Frau Skyla, welche für mich ein Charakter ist, den man nur zu gut versteht aber den man trotzdem hasst anzusehen.Auch Hank ist ein Traum - verlangt einem immer wieder ein Lachen ab!& der Sohn von Walter, Walter Junior ist auch ein totaler Sympathiecharakter.Ich kann einfach nur sagen - ich LIEBE diese Sendung :)

  hatte von freunden davon gehört nach dem ich mir eine folge angeschaut habe musste ich mir sofort staffel 1-3 bestellen und ich muss sagen ich kann es kaum abwarten bis staffel 4 auf dvd zuhaben ist...  +++ wer das nicht gesehn hat der hat echt was verpasst +++

"
  I ordered this Series, just because everyone is talking about it. I haven't begun to watch it. So I can't really say anything about the product. But it was shipped fast, had no problems at all. Even though it took a little longer cause of the strikes in Germany I imagine. But that was okay with me, I was in no hurry to get it.

  Ich habe mit etwas ganz Anderem gerechnet, als ich diese Staffel gekauft habe. Mittlerweile sind wir bei der Hälfte der zweiten Staffel angelangt und können nicht mehr aufhören. Mehr muss ich nicht sagen.....extrem!!

"
  Coole Serie! Nur die Kameraführung und die ganze Machart sind manchmal etwas gewöhnungsbedüftig, irgendwie anders. Aber nicht im negativen Sinn!Den 5. Stern bekommt sie von mir dennoch nicht, da etwas mehr Spannung hätte sein dürfen und zeitweise ist es etwas langatmig.
",4
"
  Gerade die erste Staffel finde ich (nach nun bereits mehrmaligen Schauen der Serie - auch auf englisch) besonders faszinierend. Wunderbar wie sich Walter hier wandelt..! Ja, diese Serie ist der Wahnsinn! Jeder Schauspieler überzeugt. Die Figuren von Walter White und Gus Fring (!) werden abartig geil gespielt! Es gibt Nichts, was faszinierender ist, als diese Serie. Ein Meisterwerk, auf das man sich einlassen muss. Aber dann kann man es gar nicht mehr oft genug sehen!

"
  Once you start to watch the series your hooked!! One episode is never enough, best series I've ever watched

"
  Ich wusste so wenig, aber diese Serie hat mir gezeigt, wie man Chrystal Meth herstellt und vertreibt.Eins der besten Instruktionsvideos dazu auf dem Markt, sie werden Millionen verdienen!Sie werden so viel Geld haben, dass sie Lagerräume dafür mieten müssen.Nur Vorsicht, falls ihr Schwager ein Drogenpolizist ist.
",5
"
  Wer mit ""breaking bad"" anfängt, wird NICHT nach Staffel 1 aufhören!!! Nein, er/sie wird die Serie bis zum Schluss sehen wollen. Warum??? Können Millionen Fans irren? Seit langem hat mich keine Serie (nach ""Lost"" und ""24"") mehr so gekickt und mich Blut lecken lassen, wie ""Breaking bad"". Mehr muss ich dazu nicht sagen. Ansehen, weitere Staffeln holen… mitfiebern!!!

  Die Qualität des Bildes der Blu-Ray ist längst nicht so gut wie bei der zweiten oder dritten Season, eine gute Serie verdient es aber unterstützt zu werden, deswegen war ich auch bereit für die erste Season Geld auszugeben obwohl ich sie auf ARTE längst gesehen habe.

  Grandios was das amerikanische Pay-TV abseits des Mainstreams und somit unabhängig von Quote und Massengeschmack da produziert hat. Ein tiefschwarzer Humor der einem schon beim Zuschauen körperlich weh tut, ein grandioser Hauptdarsteller und absurde und geniale Plot-Wendungen.

  Eine hochspannende Mixtur aus schwarzem Humor und Drama. Man kann sehr gut mit Walter White mitfühlen, wie ich fine. Ich saß schon oft vor dem Fernseher und dachte mir ""nein, was machst du denn jetzt für einen Mist?"" oder Ähnliches. Für mich eine der besten Serien überhaupt!

  Oft werden ja Serien in den Himmel gelobt und taugen nichts. Aber diese ist genial.Man lernt was über Chemie und wird dazu noch gut unterhalten. Das die einzelne Episode in der Rückblende erzählt wird war ein guter Zug.

Walter White ist einfach eine geniale Figur.

  Una serie straordinaria che riesce a mischiare la drammaticità della storia di Walt con la comicità. Una serie televisiva assolutamente da vedere per almeno 5 motivi: Vince (il regista) è un genio, le riprese e la fotografia sono molto belle, ottime colonne sonore e ottimo cofanetto.Il cofanetto, appunto, parliamo di quello. Il design è molto bello da vedere. In pratica è una confezione per dvd solo che più grossa e al suo interno troviamo 3 dvd (curati per bene) e una scheda sui personaggi e sugli episodi. I contenuti speciali sono veramente tanti e mi sono divertito a vederli. Infine, la qualità del video è molto buono. Considerando poi che costa solo 11 euro diventa un affarone.

  Als »Kult-Serie«, die man unbedingt gesehen habe müsse, empfahl mir ein Kollege vom RBB die US-Fernsehserie »Breaking Bad«. Dabei geht es um einen Chemielehrer, der angesichts seines bevorstehenden Krebstodes vom Wege abkommt und zu einem Kriminellen wird, während sein Schwager bei der Drogenfahndung arbeitet.Der Einstieg in die Serie ist skurril und schräg. In einem hippieesk anmutenden Szenario entschließt sich der biedere Chemielehrer Walter White (Bryan Cranston), der von seinem Lungenkrebs erfährt, sein Leben zu ändern. Das bisherige Weichei verteidigt seinen Sohn, wird zum furiosen Lover und wendet sein KnowHow schließlich dazu an, synthetische Drogen zu produzieren.Wer könnte derartiges besser als ein genialer Chemiefuchs, und so erhält das von ihm in einem Campingbus in der mexikanischen Wüste hergestellte Crystal Meth nicht nur die reinste Qualität sondern auch sehr bald höchstes Interesse der mehrheitlich jungen Kundschaft.Natürlich rufen seine Drogen-Kochkünste auch andere Dealer auf den Markt und es ist köstlich, zu beobachten, wie sich der Meisterkoch ihrer entledigt – stets nach den strengen Regeln der Chemie.Allerdings  müssen Leichen auch beseitigt werden. Und wie lässt ein Chemiker einen Toten verschwinden? – Indem er den Körper mit Flusssäure auflöst. Ist sein Dealerkumpel jedoch zu doof, auch nur die simpelsten Anweisungen zu befolgen, dann gehen dabei auch schon mal Badewanne und Zwischengeschoss zu Bruch.Vollends schwierig wird es aber, wenn das zweite Opfer plötzlich wieder zum Leben erwacht und nicht sterben will. Da bleibt wenig übrig, als den Mitwisser ebenfalls zu beseitigen und damit einen zweiten Mord zu begehen.Die Wesensänderungen des Schulmeisters bleiben nicht unbemerkt. Es gibt Nachfragen seitens seiner Frau, die entdeckt, dass ihr Göttergatte mit Dealern verkehrt und Marihuana raucht. Walter offenbart sich seiner Familie, die ihn beim Kampf gegen die Krankheit unterstützen will. Er möchte sich jedoch nicht für eine teure Krebstherapie in finanzielle Abhängigkeiten stürzen und dann einen Riesenhaufen Schulden hinterlassen. Obwohl seine Freunde ihm die Bezahlung seiner Therapie anbieten, lehnt sein Stolz das ab.Walter will alles selbst bezahlen und auch noch Geld hinterlassen, um seine Angehörigen zu versorgen. Er geht wieder auf seinen Drogenkumpel zu und kocht neues Dope. Seine Lebensuhr tickt, und um schneller als per Einzelhandel zu Geld zu kommen, wollen sie an einen Zwischenhändler verkaufen. Doch das geht erst mal schief. So nimmt Walter die Geschichte selbst in die Hand und setzt erneut sein Chemo-Wissen ein, diesmal mit Knall-Quecksilber. Die Geschichte gewinnt an Fahrt und wird zunehmend zu einer farbenprächtigen Odyssee durch die US-Drogenszene mit brutalen Splatter-Einsprengseln.Hervorragende Schauspieler – milieudichte Schilderung»Breaking Bad« besticht vor allem durch die schauspielerischen Qualitäten des Protagonisten Bryan Cranston, der die Entwicklung ebenso wie die inneren Zweifel und Widersprüche glaubhaft werden lassen. Die Beiträge sind milieudicht geschildert, vor allem die heruntergekommene kriminelle Welt der Drogenszene wird anschaulich dargestellt.Ob nun ein Mensch, der von seinem bevorstehenden Krebstod erfährt, tatsächlich in der Lage ist, sein Leben derart radikal zu ändern und zu einem Kriminellen werden kann, bezweifele ich aufgrund eigener klinischer Anamnese. Wer derartiges erfährt, ist meistens vollkommen geplättet und sinkt in Depression, die sich dann häufig in Wut verwandelt. Eine derartige Fragestellung sollte also, obwohl sie als Ausgangspunkt zentral ist, bei der Beurteilung dieser Serie ausgespart werden.Ein interessanter Aspekt ist hingegen die Kriminalisierung der kleinen Marihuana-Raucher, die in der Serie überdeutlich wird. Wer Haschisch genießen will, wird aufgrund der Gesetzeslage in die Arme der Drogenmafia getrieben und erhält sehr schnell Zugang zu brutalen Drogen wie Crystal Meth, die den Körper verwüsten und eine totale Abhängigkeit schaffen.Sieht man »Breaking Bad« unter diesem Aspekt, lassen sich stichhaltige Argumente für die kontrollierte Abgabe von Marihuana über Coffee-Shops (Modell  Niederlande) oder Apotheken finden.

  鮮烈なブリーフ姿のジャケ写真の本作がお薦めページにしつこく掲載されていて、或る日、気まぐれに購入してみましたが、これまでにない味わいの作品です。ドラッグを扱ったテーマは珍しくもないですが、一般の人の日常に起きるトラブルや些細な感情のゆらぎが丁寧に描かれていて、久しぶりに深く感情移入して観てしまいました。この作品がクセになるポイントとして、主人公２人（ホワイトとジェシー）が仕出かしてしまう「どうしようもないポカ」の連続が上げられます。観ている側が「えっ何でそうするの？」「だめだめ」とテレビの前でツッコミを入れ続けながら、気がつくと作品世界に取り込まれていました。一般人のごくありふれた日常とフィクションの極致とも言えるドラッグ商売のコントラストが観るものを飽きさせず、全体としてクライムものでもなく、またホームコメディものでもないバランスのとれた仕上がりになっています。

  Ihr schreibt hier das ihr amazon prime nur wegen der serie aboniert habt? Sorry leute aber für das geld hättet ihr fast die komplettbox bekommen.

Und seit mit dem zufrieden was es gibt. Serien zu produzieren kostet geld, filme kosten geld, musik kostet geld, versand kostet geld. Und ihr mault über die mitgliedskosten?

  Acccording to Wikipedia the first series of Breaking Bad stopped abruptly because of the writers' strike. I can well believe it.  When my partner said ""that was the last episode"" I couldn't believe it.  It just stops. Talk about frustration.As to the series, it has sparkling moments tucked away in a lot of wrapping, or should I say padding. In other words, it's sometimes a bit slow. I may buy the second series ""faute de mieux"" but if I don't it really doesn't matter. It's reasonably original and a way of passing the long winter evenings, but most of the characters are one dimensional, so it's a bit of a meringue.  I would NOT compare it to the Sopranos. And with that my review ends as abruptly as the series!

  fragt man sich schon in Folge 1. ... Problem für mich bei dieser Serie. Keine Identifikationsfigur. Alle haben irgendwie ne Schramme, und zwar keine liebenswerte.

  Adoro le serie americane. Guarderei solo loro in tv. Questa mi è stata consigliata da amici e devo dire che la trovo molto coinvolgente.

C'è però qualcosa che non mi convince, il ritmo è un po' troppo lento e la malattia del protagonista la rende a volte un po' angosciante. In ogni modo, penso che la guarderò fino all'ultimo capitolo.

  First off i've never written a customer review on amazon or any other site ever, normally the good stuff has largely positive reviews and the bad stuff largely negative, i.e its easy to make an informed decision. But with this series (and i mean in the uk) its been completely overlooked for some reason.Ive seen all three seasons and without giving any spoliers suffice to say it just gets better amd better, everything is like one long huge film rather than having any 'filler' episodes but each one still remains unique, great writing and acting all around.Comparing this to any other tv is a bit redundant its so original, the way its shot as well (in parts) is beautiful the dialouge is snappy and theres black humour (the best) throughout with a healthy dose of 'serious' moments too and it definitely makes you think.More than anything though its just fun,classy tv and i think will appeal to allsorts. So buy it, watch it, love it (inevitably) and spread the word.Hopefully they release the third season in the uk soon and this doesnt become something us brits overlook completely. Its better than most other programmes out there its just hard to find it on.

  面白いって噂だから見てみようと思いシーズン１だけ最初買いました。面白いはずって先入観が先行し過ぎたためか、シーズン１はまぁまぁ面白かったって感じです。シーズン１ラスト盛り上がります。でシーズン２以降をまとめて買ったんですが、シーズン２は…面白くないって事もないけど…あれだけ面白いって勧められた割には…って感じでした。シーズン３の途中からもう目が離せないくらい劇的に面白くなってきます。シーズン４が最高に面白くて５→６も面白いです。最終話は本当に心打たれました。何が言いたいかって言うと、シーズンの最初だけ観てこの作品を投げないでほしいって思ったので書きました。これはガチで面白かったあらすじは誰か書いてくれてるんで、全体のザクッとした盛り上がり感を書いてみました。

  Oil paint that is. The characters are flat, lack charisma, it is impossible to sympathise with any of them. The storyline is mediocre at best. I'm glad I bought it cheaply in the used section of Amazon.In spite of the nearly general public acclaim, I would advise anyone not to bother...

  .......über 270 Rezensionen,die mit fünf Sternen auszeichnen.Warum bloss?Also, ich habe mir die ersten beiden Staffeln geordert, weil derHype um diese Serie so wahnsinnig groß und weil sie so in den Himmelgelobt wird.HAST DU SCHON BREAKING BAD GESEHEN?SCHAU DIR BREAKING BAD AN, DANN WEISST DU, WAS SPANNUNG IST!!WAS? DU KENNST BREAKING BAD NOCH NICHT? UNFASSBAR!!Nun gut, dachte ich mir; sie waren gottlob nicht mehr so teuer.Und nach der ersten Staffel bin ich so gar nicht mehr davon überzeugt,daß die Zweite (noch) spannender wird.WAS habe ich bisher gesehen? Gelernt?Da braut sich ein krebskranker, begabter Chemiker die Droge Cristal- Meth.Und die geht so astrein und kristallklar ab, daß der/die Dealer nach nemProbelauf sogar den "" Kumpel"" halb tot schlagen! Furios!!Schön brutal natürlich, für den, der drauf abfährt.Die Handlung wirkt zwar kaum logisch, sehr übertrieben.Die Serie birgt in meinen Augen keinesfalls nachvollziehbare Charaktere-dennoch sagt sie zwischen den Zeilen die Anklage aus; die Gesellschaftkümmert sich nicht genug um ihre Kranken, Fleissigen und Cleveren.Dass sie sie viel mehr betrügt, ausbeutet und ihnen keine andere Wahlals Entfremdung, Qual und Tyrannei bleibt.Daß man wirklich ""reich"" wird, wenn man festgefahrene, berufliche Pfadeverlässt- wenn man sich an diesen Zuständen rächt, indem man die Gesellschaftmissachtet und sich strikt gegen sie wendet.Im Grunde plädiert diese Serie wohl für die Revolution, die Umwälzung sämtlicherVerhältnisse, die den Menschen zu einem geknechteten, unmündigem Wesen machen.Nun ja......Meinungsfreiheit sei wenigstens geachtet!---------------------------------------------Story:Da schreibe ich diesmal nix, kann man ja bei fast 4oo Rezis sehen.Ausserdem ist die Serie ja wohl bekannt wie ein bunter Hund.---------------------------------------------------Mein Fazit ( erst mal)!Die grotesken Situationen, die Heisenberg und Pinkman erleben,legen also Zeugnis über eine verrückte Welt ab.Es ist ein Leben am Limit, und darüber hinaus.Der Mensch als Material- seine Bedürfnisse und Gefühle habeneine geringe Priorität.Und er ist scheinbar machtloses Anhängsel der Verhältnisse,die er einst selbst geschaffen hat.Es gibt nur noch den Überlebenskampf, kein Leben mehr.Werde mich durch die hoffentlich nicht so zähe nächste Staffelwühlen, und entweder war`s das dann.....oder......mal sehen.Was kann da noch kommen? Brutaler geht halt immer.Werden ich doch noch im Hype gefangen?____________________________________________________Die drei Sterne sind entweder zu viel oder zu wenig......weiss noch nicht. Vielleicht korrigiere ich demnächst.Positiv oder negativ- wir werden sehen.

  Calma, le 3 stelle vanno contestualizzate: ho rivisto questa prima serie più e più volte ed è innegabile che il fascino insito nella trama e nei personaggi sia innegabile; le vicende del protagonista sicuramente sapranno rapirvi e commuovermi. Tuttavia, personalmente, il ritmo è piuttosto lento, ci sono tanti momenti morti e le tematiche non sono sviluppate nel migliore dei modi.Sono sicuro però che tutto ciò che di buono c'è in questa 1°stagione verrà elevato all'ennesima potenza nelle stagioni che verranno, e ci tengo a sottolinearlo: IL POTENZIALE E' ENORME!!!Consiglio a tutti la visione. Le 3 stelle è comunque un voto positivo e uno ""stimolo"" a fare di meglio nelle serie che verranno.

  Hallo zusammen,ich habe mir diese Serie ""auf Gut Glück"" hier bei amazon.de bestellt. Bei 12,99 € kann man nicht viel falsch machen, und bei den vielen guten Bewertungen lohnt es sich sicher das Produkt näher zu betrachten.Die Serie kam wie gewohnt nach zwei Tagen bei mir an.Zur Serie:Meine Freundin und ich haben uns die Serie auf drei Tagen reingezogen und waren begeistert (Kritiken zur Serie gibt es hier ja genügend!)Vor zwei Tagen habe ich gleich Staffel 2 und 3 (für den super Tagespreis von 11,97 € je Staffel bestellt!).Serie: 5 / 5 Sterne (!)Zur Verpackung:Die Hülle, in der die drei CD's eingelegt sind, zieht meine Bewertung leider runter!Diese riecht furchtbar nach verbrannten Reifen. Eine Grundreinigung mit Wasser und Seife hat den Gestank etwas abgemildert, aber das ist ein Zustand, den ich von amazon normalerweise nicht kenne. Ich gehe davon aus, dass es sich hierbei um einen Einzelfall handelt, daher wollte ich die Ware auch nicht zurücksenden. Ich beobachte nun die Aufmachung bei Staffel 2 und 3, und hoffe dass sich diese ""Unanehmlichkeit"" hier nicht wiederholt.Verpackung: 0 / 5 Sterne (!)Insgesamt komme ich daher auf eine ""durchschnittliche"" Bewertung, und gebe 3 Sterne von 5.

  The synopsis (with NO SPOILERS):A US chemistry teacher (Bryan Cranston, fom 'Malcolm in the Middle') discovers he has cancer, and has no way of paying the medical bills. One day it occurs to him that he could cover the needed expenses by making Crystal Meth - a drug which is in high demand on the streets. The series follows his adventures, and the ever-increasingly tangled web of lies that he weaves.I've got to say how much I LOVED this series - season 1 is relatively short (7 episodes), but is filled with the kind of high-tension drama that made 'The Wire' so compelling. It's created by Vince Gilligan (the man behind 'The X-Files'* [*see comment]), and has the same quirky humour threaded all the way through - aided immensely by Cranston's witheringly caustic portrayal of a man who does not suffer fools gladly AT ALL, but ends up having to work with one.As events unfurl, he is forced to keep bigger and bigger secrets from his wife and son...I don't want to give the impression that this is primarily a comedy, because it isn't - it's a dark psychological drama with some great moments of equally dark humour - the cast are all exceptional, and the casting is spot-on. For example, Cranston's character has a son who has CP, so they cast RJ Mitte, an actor who actually has it in real life. This might seem a little worthy but when watching the series it works perfectly.If you liked the grittiness of 'The Wire', the dark humour of 'The Sopranos' or the strange other-ness of 'The X-Files', I can recommend this to you WHOLEHEARTEDLY. Seriously - this is the best thing I've seen on TV for a long long time... and the good news is that series 2 is just as good, but 12 episodes long!Take a chance - buy it - I promise you won't regret it.

  In ""Breaking Bad"" geht es um den ca. 50jährigen Walter White, der ein vom Leben eher frustrierter Chemielehrer an einer amerikanischen High School ist. Er erfährt, dass er Lungenkrebs hat, der kaum behandelbar ist und vermutlich in wenigen Jahren zum Tod führt. Damit er seiner Familie (die Frau ist gerade schwanger; es gibt eine ca. 17/18jährigen Sohn, der nach einem Unfall gehbehindert ist) Geld hinterlassen kann beginnt er mit einem ehemaligen Schüler von ihm, der mit Drogen dealt, Crack zu kochen, das aufgrund seiner guten Chemiekenntnisse von hoher Reinheit ist und daher am Markt sehr erfolgreich. Die sieben mit je ca. 45 Minuten erzählen seine Erlebnisse in der Drogenszene, die eigene Auseinandersetzung mit der Krankheit, wie seine Familie damit umgeht und wie schließlich doch der medizinische Kampf dagegen aufgenommen wird. Der Erzählstil ist dabei mal tragisch-heiter, mal dramatisch, mal lakonisch, mal grotesk.Ich bin mit der Serie im ganzen nicht warm geworden. Rein subjektiv hätte ich nur drei Sterne gegeben und werde mir sicher die zweite Staffel nicht mehr zulegen; man kann aber wg. unbestreitbarer Qualitäten und guter Ansätze vier Sterne vertreten, v.a. im Vergleich zu dem, was sonst so auf dem Markt ist:- Der Grundplot ist trotz der Ähnlichkeit zu ""Weeds"" gut und pfiffig.- Die Figur des Walter White hat Ausstrahlung und eine gewisse Klasse. V.a. gefällt mir seine Zelebrierung der Chemie (etwas langweiliger finde ich hingegen die Frustriertheit; frustrierte Lehrer hat es in Literatur und TV schon zu viele gegeben).- Manche Einzelszenen und Dialoge sind grandios (z.B. wenn White seiner Frau von der Krankheit erzählt oder ein Gespräch von ihm mit einem gefesselten Drogendealer).- Ausstattung, Kameraführung, Kulisse und weitestgehend schauspielerische Leistungen sind auf hohem Niveau.- Die Gesamtkomposition ist komplett und interessant. Es gibt eine Reihe von überraschenden, einfallsreichen Handlungswendungen.Was mich aber gestört hat:- Es gibt ebenso eine Reihe von wenig gelungen, weil zu grotesken oder unrealistischen Szenen (v.a. Whites Begegnungen mit den echten, gewalttätigen Gangstern).- Manche Figuren sind in sich zu widersprüchlich (v.a. die seiner Frau, die unharmonisch mal tiefsinnige Dialogpartnerin, mal aufgeregtes Huhn ist).- Auch auf die Gefahr hin, dass mich manche lynchen: Mich hat Bryan Cranstons Spiel als Walter White nicht wirklich überzeugt, es ist mir zu agitiert und aufdringlich (v.a. der ausgiebige Gebrauch des Kiefers).- Am schwersten wiegen aber zwei schwere dramaturgische Fehler: (1) White ist kurz davor als über Fünfzigjähriger noch mal Vater zu werden. Diese an sich eher ungewöhnlich Konstellation wird kaum thematisiert und spielt auch in seiner Einstellung zum möglichen nahenden Tod eine viel zu kleine Rolle. Angesichts der Freude auf ein neues Kind, die man der Figur angesichts ihres sonstigen Charakters unterstellt, wirkt sein Verhalten nicht stimmig und die Kaum-Beachtung des Aspekts völlig befremdlich. (2) Es wird eine Option mit den finanziellen Problemen umzugehen ins Spiel gebracht, die jenseits der Kriminialität liegt und diese eigentlich unnötig macht. Whites Verhalten wandelt sich dadurch für mich vom irgendwo berührenden Verhalten eines zu Recht von der Eintönigkeit und Dummheit des Lebens frustrierten Durchschnittsbürger zur eher primitiven Marotte des eitlen Kleinspießers. Die Figur verliert deutlich an Symapthie und Tiefe. Dies ist umso ärgerlicher als dass dieses Handlungselement eigentlich völlig unnötig war.Fazit: Bei handwerklichen Stärken und einigen sehr, sehr starken Einzelszenen und -elementen gleichzeitig auch punktuelle und durchgehende Schwächen. Im Ansatz stark, in der Durchführung leider nicht überzeugend. Sprachlich fand ich die englische Version (mit englischen UT) etwas ansprechender; die Orginalsprache bringt hier für mich aber nicht den großen Fortschritt wie bei manch anderen Serien (z.B. Sopranos oder Deadwood).

  Voller Erwartung ging ich an diese Serie heran. Als Vollblut-Serienjunkie hoffte ich, auch wg. ausschließlich positiver Rückmeldung seitens Freunden und Arbeitskollegen, endlich wieder einen Dauerbrenner in Händen zu halten :)Leider muss ich sagen, dass mich Breaking Bad doch recht enttäuscht hat. Das hat mehrere Gründe:- Spannende Momente sind mehr als rar gesäht. Aneinander gereiht konnten mich schätzungsweise 20 Min der kompletten Staffel wirklich fesseln, bevor wieder, teils folgenlang, wirklich gar nichts geschah...- Zu den Charakteren konnte ich absolut keinen Bezug aufbauen. Walter Jr. war mir von Anfang an unsympathisch, Skyler wirkt grau und unscheinbar und Jesse hätte ich das ein- oder andere Mal selbst gern verprügelt ;)- Die scheinbar nicht enden wollenden Dialoge....blablablablaWas mir hingegen gefallen hat, ist folgendes:- die düstere Atmosphäre ist fantastisch gelungen. Auch der schwarzer Humor hat seine Wirkung bei mir nicht verfehlt- die Schauspieler sind (teilweise) absolut brilliant.- Hank und Walter - beide Charaktere finde ich super. Walter's Art zu denken und zu handeln ist für mich nicht nachvollziehbar, allerdings macht gerade das für mich den Reiz aus. Hank ist einfach nur zum brüllen komischDa leider weder Atmo noch die schauspielerischen Leistungen über ca. 5,5, bestenfalls langatmiger, Studen hinweghalfen, vergebe ich drei Sterne. Trotzdem werde ich mir die zweite Staffel wenigstens ausleihen....als Hintergrundgeplänkel wenn ich Stricke ist es allemal gut ;p

  Everybody seemed to love this .. but I didnt get past the 2nd episode.  All the characters were irritating.. far too much middle aged man in Y fronts and plaid shirt .. I am sure I missed the point as it gets so many fab reviewd but I have tried twice now to watch Season 1... perhaps it gets better later on.. but I gave up.

  Ich habe noch nie eine negative Bewertung geschrieben aber das was Amazon sich da geleistet hat ist eine absolute Frechheit. Habe mir heute die Serie bei Media Markt organisiert und werde zukünftig meine weiteren Einkäufe über Amazon ebenenfalls überdenken.Ich erwarte eine Stellungnahme oder ihr habt einen weiteren Kunden verloren.

  Ich bin immer wieder auf der Suche nach Serien, die etwas anders sind oder originell und dabei u. a. auf Breaking Bad gestossen. Und obwohl mich der Inhalt sehr angesprochen hat, ist es der ersten Staffel nicht gelungen, mich zu packen. Ja, die Ereignisse sind dramatisch und die Handlung mal wirklich etwas anderes, trotzdem hat sie mich relativ kalt gelassen. Ich hab sie gleich weiter verkauft.

  J'attendais davantage de cette série qui finalement a fini dans les bras d'un autre. Je l'ai donnée. Je crois même que je n'ai même pas pu la visionnée jusqu'au bout. C'était désespérant et inintéressant.

  Ich denke, dass Unzufriedenheit häufig durch falsche Erwartungen entsteht.So war es auch bei mir!Viel Gutes habe ich von allen Seiten gehört und hoffte auf eine spannende Serie mit einer Prise Witz, viel Chemie, die auf Grund des vielen Lobs zu einer neuen Lieblingsserie für Zwichendurch werden könnte.Woran lag es nun, dass ich so enttäuscht bin?Zum einen gibt es kaum Witz in dieser Serie (ich habe nur die erste Staffel gesehen).Zum anderen ist die Serie NICHT positiv!Ich möchte dafür keine Anfeindungen, denn das sind 2 Tatsachen!Die Serie handelt nicht von jemandem, der versucht für die letzten Monate seines Lebens Hoffnung zu gewinne und noch etwas sinnvolles aus seinem Leben zu machen.Diese Serie handelt von jemandem, der sich aus Verzweiflung auf das Drogengeschäft einlässt und durch eine Reihe von zahlreichen unmoralischen Entscheidungen, die jeder Zuschauer für sich als falsch betrachten sollte, in eine Abwärtsspirale geräht, seine Seele verkauft und dadurch an die Grenzen seiner Menschlichkeit stößt.Mich konnte die Serie nicht überzeugen, weil sie in den ersten Folgen übertrieben und unnötig eklig war und keiner der Charaktere sympatisch wirkt. Dadurch, dass ich mich mit keinem identifizieren konnte oder ansatzweise Sympathie empfand, konnte ich auch nicht mit der Geschichte mitfiebern.Wer gerne Serien schaut, die von Typen handeln, die auf die schiefe Bahn geraten, dort nicht mehr herunter kommen und ihr sowieso schon schlimmes Leben für sich und andere noch schlimmer machen, dem empfehle ich diese Serie.Solch negative Geschichten, wie die von Walter White haben durchaus ihre Berechtigung, ich kann also verstehen, dass sie eine Gruppe von Leuten anspricht. Den weltweiten Erfolg kann ich mir allerdings nur dadurch erklären, dass die Story neu und einzigartig ist.Fazit:Von mir gibt es nur 2 Sterne, weil ich die Staffel/Serie zu trostlos, perspektivlos, grausam, unmoralisch und unsympatisch fand.

  Horrible uncomfortable viewing. Could only get to the end of the second episode. I really think it should have gripped me by then...

  Die Idee der Geschichte ist schon gut. Wie ein remake von Wim Wenders der amerikanische Freund. Aber dann geht die Serie über zu den üblichen Gewalt und Horror Geschichten die sich so gut verkaufen lassen. Meine Begeisterung hält sich in Grenzen.

  シーズン毎にだいたい完結しているので、このシーズンだけ見ておしまいにしても大丈夫です。次のシーズンからは、見る人を選ぶというか、冗談半分に見ることができる人だと完走できます。もし、スカパーが視聴できる環境でしたら、ドラマチャンネルでやっているので、それを見て、気に入ったらソフトを買う、それがいちばんだと思います。主人公の役回りは、例えば悪役専門の俳優みたいに、ああ、この人だったらこうゆうことして、こんな風になるよね、いつもと同じだ、と見ている方を安心させるような感じです。なので、あまりシリアスに受け止めると鬱になるか、腹が立つかのどちらかでしょうね。画はきれいです。アメリカの荒野とか、地方都市の町並みとか、いろいろ出てきますが、ああキレイだなぁ、と思いました。カメラワークは凝っています。名作とか傑作とか、そこまで褒めるようなアメリカドラマでは無いと思います。まさかそんなに上手く行くわけ無いだろ、とか、やたら「プロ」な人たちがゾロゾロと出てきて無理を強引に通してしまうようなご都合主義もあります。思わせぶりでありながらガッカリ、というところもたくさんあります。それでもこの作品が気に入れば、最後まで面白く見ることができるでしょう。悪く言えばマニア向け、なのかも知れません。

  I bought these box sets to take on holiday with me but none of them played properly; good picture but the dialogue was in audible.I will test them on my DVD player at home but it looks as though I now have the hassle of sending them back!

  Tried the first 4 or 5 episodes but found the plot and script very obvious and unsubtle, from the silly underpants to the endlessly.....SPOILER ALERT.....drawn out killing of the drug dealer in the basement. All the characters seemed charicatures and the one ""joke"" was a middle aged fuddy-duddy getting into the drugs scene. Poor.

  I bought the first 3 seasons but after watching the 1st, sent the other 2 back. The premise is good, the writing is good but it's a tad over acted and the director's pacing is SLOOOOOOW! There are several scenes where a bit of cutting was called for (eg the scene with the drug dealer in the basement) and some unbelievable stuff. The guy is a buttoned-down civilian, just freshly ""broken bad"", the way he drove the RV in the desert was not credible. The knowledge of chemistry was poor. Hydrofluoric acid is so dangerous that many high schools would not stock it even for teacher demos, let alone have, what, two 50 litre demijohns of it. If they really had all that stuff fall through the ceiling, both of them would have suffered fatal injuries from absorbing it through the skin. I also hate these Clint Eastwood type characters who try to control everything by not sharing anything with their significant others, and who treat women like chattels, something that to me made Don Draper despicable in Mad Men. There was altogether too much explaining of things that didn't need explaining. If you want to see what happens when they get the writing, the acting and the directing right, see The Wire.

  I didn't know what to expect when I bought this set, though I read the outline about the unusual plot and noticed the approval-ratings. How many episodes of this do you have to watch before you think it's wonderful? By the end of episode 2, I felt ill, hated it, and won't be watching any more !I don't get tv, and several times I've plumped for a dvd set on the basis of its acclaim -and then found I could not agree  with all the fuss. No doubt you feel my taste is up the creek -but this is an honest personal reaction to what I saw.After 2 episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" the characterisation remained weak and uninteresting, most of the acting would get wood a bad name, and the subject matter,  including heartless murder, sadism, and  decomposing bodies, ingenious  but utterly repulsive. So this is black humour? and funny? -I don't think! If I'd known all this was on the agenda, I wouldn't have forked out.Puzzled isn't the word, I really like to laugh and that's what I was hoping for. Unfortunately I happened to watch this just after recent awful gun-events at a  US school and it made a difference. Not funny but alarming is how I found this ugly stuff.

  bei Breaking Bad scheiden sich die Geister. Ich habe die Serie gekaut, weil sie von vielen empfohlen wird. Für uns war sie aber langweilig und nicht fesselnd.

  Bin überrascht über den Run auf diese Serie. Zugegeben Staffel 1. war ja noch ganz spannend, und auch gut gemachtaber im Grund ist es doch immerwieder die selbe Story, das selbe Schema.Walt kocht, kocht nicht, lässt sich wieder überreden....Dann Skyler, steif und ewig nörgelnd und unzugänglich, wird immer nerviger!! auch immerwieder das selbe Schema... und dann... Jesse der ewige Looser der Story, der regelmäßig alle paar Folgen mal wieder verprügelt wird....Gähn... Immerwieder die selbe Leier mit wenigen Überraschungen...2 Sterne weil Staffel 1 ganz gut gemacht ist, aber Staffel 2+3 kann man sich echt sparen!

  die Geschichte und Personen entwickeln sich im Schneckentempo. Es gibt wenig, was überrascht hat. Vom Konzenpt her hätte die Idee viel mehr hergegeben (z.B. Lehrer wird Drogenpate gepaart mit witziger Gesellschaftskritik). Ich fand es so langweilig, dass ich es nicht mehr bis zum Ende der Staffel geschafft habe.

  The dvd I ordered was classified as region 1 (North America) unknown to me the UK is region 2. As a result of this I returned the item & asked the supplier if they could exchange it for region 2, they were unable to do this.  They are in the course of refunding me,however, I have incurred a £4.50 P&P, this I'm unhappy about.

  The details say ""all regions"" the header does not. Pay attention to the header. Goodness knows why you can't buy bluerays for the uk of this yet but this won't play in your PS3 - well it won't play inours

  Slow and predictable.Myself and my partner are in complete agreement. Which, at the time of writing, totals four people giving this a one-star rating on Amazon. Is there a 'joke' Breaking Bad that I received?The characters are very one-dimensional. I was looking forward to seeing Malcolm in the Middle's 'Hal"" in a serious/darkly comic role, but it turns out he only has one serious face in his acting arsenal- dipped corners of his mouth, slight pout and the ever-present frown. Even before he was diagnosed with cancer. If someone did a Youtube mash-up of this expression, they would have ten minutes of solid footage. It looks like he grows a goatee for later series, so I wonder how he will be able to act.As for the rest of the cast, there is just no characterization that makes me care about them. Upon viewing, I could believe that the producers completely forgot to give the supporting cast any depth or personality, so sliced in one brief scene (for example his sister-in-law's kleptomania) in one episode to make them 'deep' and 'complex' after panicking that they may have a rotter of a show on their hands. Twilight characters have more depth than these people.And his partner-in-cooking's acting is so bad at times he not only distracts from the 'drama', but cheapens the whole show.Predictable: I don't want to be an ass and give anything away, so I will just ask if anyone who watched the 'Cancer Man' episode didn't see that ending coming?I just can't comprehend the scores of excellent reviews, it was a chore to get through all the episodes. I only finished it so I could justifiably write this review.

  この★一つの意味は 愛情の裏返しです。小さな時に女の子にわざと意地悪 するのと同じ感じです。本当は大好きなのに・・・ 人にはお勧め出来ません。したくありません。て言うか絶対しません。 こんなに面白い作品は滅多にないので,こっそりと楽しんで優越感に浸りたいので。もし見たいなら自分で探し出して欲しいです。クソみたいな日本のドラマには無い味わいです。最高です！　　追加 かなり時間が開いて見直しました。相変わらずこっそり妻二人だけで楽しんでおります。シーズン4まで見終わってますが、テンションは上がりまくりです。純度100%です。中毒性のある危険なドラマ。欲しがりな大人向けドラマですよ。 メーカー様 早くシーズン3のDVDを出してください。

  I watched the first two episodes of this. Sadly had to conclude that this is the first really bad HBO produced box set that I've bought. I wasn't sure whether to watch this as a comedy or a drama as the humour left me cold and the drama left me entirely unconvinced.There couold have been some potential with the idea but it was entirely lost in the execution. Both the acting and the writing are two dimensional so that I quickly ceased to care if the main character is (a)unjustly impoverished by the American dream (b)dieing of cancer, (c)compromising his morals as a chemistry teacher and family man, (d) murdering fellow drug dealers. There was little to no inner conflict portrayed considering the compromising nature of the situations, so no drama, yet comedy wise, with bodies that were nearly beaten to death coming back to life, it was mirthless and too derivative to have any shock value.I expect that in the right comedic hands there is potential in the spectacle of poor and desperate people doing dangerous and humiliating things to try and escape their situation. In this instance it just makes flat-footed drama.
